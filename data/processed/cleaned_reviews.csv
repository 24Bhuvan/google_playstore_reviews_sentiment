love this app but some functions make the productivity lacking in my experience there is a limited amount of notifications i can receive from this app per day there appears to be no way to change this on the settings for my phone or the app this is problematic for me because i have the premium version and have it connected to zapier i am not receiving push notifications when actions are taking place very disappointing as this is crucial for time management projects with teams,3,2020-10-11 05:54:05,70,

i have used this app for years it is great if you want to be more organized and get reminders of the tasks you need to do i must say however that the app itself has regressed throughout the years with all the updates things used to be simple and intuitive now i don t understand what half the buttons do basic functions like deleting and removing tasks are way too clunky the concept of the app is great but i can t recommend it anymore each update makes it worse,3,2020-10-08 15:20:02,156,"Please note that completing and deleting tasks, have stayed the same all along.

just enough features to be useful yet simple and mostly uncluttered been using the app for years the new rocket animation showing total tasks completed and congratulating me for the most mundane thing is extremely irritating though and lost the app a star,3,2020-09-30 18:30:02,23,Please note that this banner appears only when removing a task but not when completing it.

to be fair i downloaded it and uninstalled it after a couple of minutes the reason for this is that i hate apps that scream pay me money since the instance you download it and this one did that exactly with the free premium trial being in your face all the time and then setting it up or going through the tutorial you could see all the features and all you could see is premium just do the app as a paid one instead of begging for people to pay for it it looks amazing though,3,2020-09-26 04:28:12,1,"Please note that 90% of the app is completely free, and we allow our users to enjoy all core features for as much as they wish without a requirement to upgrade :) The Premium ad only shows up when first opening the app, and when clicking on a Premium feature.

this is my favorite to do type of app it s gorgeous on an oled display but i really wish there were a better way to set up repeatable checklists to start a good habit i find the reminder to do it everyday very helpfyl but even better is tracking how many times i actually did after a week and when this app allows repeat events with notifications but doesn t track time completed or show completed or incomplete events on cal or google calendar so making schedule adjustments is a chore,4,2020-07-26 04:37:39,21,Thank you for the suggestion.

relocate the delete task mark as done tabs i have a galaxy note 10 and quite likely w other phones when i motion to press my navigation button on the bottom right or the open application button on the bottom left i am frequently accidentally tapping the mark as done or delete task tabs and have to to manage or recreate my my task details that i was already working with aside from being increasingly frustrating aggravating and annoying this becomes a time waster,4,2020-07-25 17:55:56,0,
honestly needs a lot more features for me to be worth paying premium for i tried out the free trial the deal breaker for me was the fact that i can t set custom alerts for calender events maximum i can do is 2 days before event why can t i customize it i e 2 weeks or 10 days then they need other things like automatic dark theme switching other than that it s a nice productivity app love that it combines tasks and events into the calendar,4,2020-07-23 22:39:29,27,"Any.do is a free app. We provide 90% of our features at no cost, including all core features.

clean simple interface generally fast and easy to add things as i think of them however i wish the app didn t think it was so smart i find the auto spelling annoying putting in 8 10 ft electric cord under lists was automatically interpreted as august 10th and the assumptions about categories for shopping lists is annoying 5 different things to get a hardware store end up in 4 different categories changing the categories for shopping lists is not easy to manage and why do they show up under tasks at all,4,2020-07-21 22:12:24,6,"Sorry about that!

this could be an awesome app it has great potential except for a few flaws that end up making it a super irritating app i have reported these issues to the app s tech support several times only to get lame responses with no resolutions the latest being that when items are entered into a category in this app the app for some reason resorts the sequence of items in my list automatically i put these items in the list in a certain order for a reason i have other issues but no moreroomher,4,2020-05-16 20:28:51,74,"Hi Jason, as far as we can see in your latest reply to our team you reported that the issue was resolved as well as rated our support positively, so we are not sure what you're referring to.

useful app but with the latest update that incorporates language automatically into setting the time it will delete times that are part of my reminder for instance if i want to say go to a meeting at 3 30 it will delete the words at 3 30 and set the remind to 3 30 so if i wanted my reminder to tell me what time the meeting was i can t see it anymore too bad this option can t be turned off,4,2020-05-15 11:02:47,173,"Sorry for the inconvenience.

excellent,5,2020-10-11 15:09:20,1,
only thing that could make this better and maybe i m just too dumb to figure out lol how to make it work is if as long as the apps open you could just talk into your phone and say like task event instead of having to stop and type it you know but that s my two cents i still love it thank you,5,2020-10-11 14:06:10,0,"Please note that we've recently released a new feature called Smart Type, which allows you to add a task using natural tongue, and determine the Reminder date automatically.

so far so good i just download this to help my husband be more organized,5,2020-10-11 06:47:55,0,
i like this app for the most part loads of different plugins however if you want to change the date for your reminder from the default date it takes 7 taps seven that is not great ux and needs to improve i miss the wunderlist style smart date adding update the new smart date feature makes this a 5 star app for me,5,2020-10-10 19:11:41,6,"Please note that we've recently released a new feature called Smart Type, which allows you to add a task using natural tongue, and determine the Reminder date automatically.

reminder isnt part of standard app needs upgrade,1,2020-10-27 14:10:57,0,
reminders are a premium feature you have to pay for this should be basic,1,2020-10-26 21:31:53,0,
using this app for atleast 5 yrs and suddenly the team choose to make reminders a paid feature i mean if you are so desperate atleast set a small amount for reminders but that s unacceptable to pay full premium for such a small feature which was the basic thing since the start goodbye todoist edit after reply so you mean me every other person who is complaining are all wrong reminders were never premium until some time ago i was using that for more than 5 yrs on free plan have courtesy to not lie atleast,1,2020-10-26 15:28:31,26,"Hi Saksham, reminders feature has been a premium-only feature since the beginning. Could you clarify what happened?"
i was recently diagnosed with inattentive adhd and was hoping this app would be an answered prayer for help managing the symptoms but nothing has changed with reminders since my last attempt at using this come on todoist reminders should never be a premium feature in a task management app,1,2020-10-26 06:12:03,3,
i was super happy to download this app but that i soon realized that you have to pay for an alarm so that you get notified for your to do list,1,2020-10-24 03:22:04,1,
i would give todoist more than five stars however you keep ignoring users for enabling them to show completed tasks by default is just irresponsible please add an option to always show completed tasks,1,2020-10-23 14:13:01,1,"We are looking into this, Mohammed! For now, your completed sub-tasks will show up automatically when opening the task view of a parent task :)"
horrible most of it you have to pay even to put a simple reminder,1,2020-10-23 00:35:32,0,

constantly buggy i ve used this app for five years and they are always pushing bad releases right now there is a crash expanding lists which would have been found with some quick testing several years ago i filed a ticket for a big where it jumbles up sublists every few months i check in and out still isn t fixed the web app is not letting you expand sections the windows app was scrambling the order for months they must do zero quality control,1,2020-10-14 09:49:41,36,"Hi Martin, as for the crash issue on the Android app, it is now fixed in the current version.

12 hours just 12 hours i had this app received 6 emails for todoist why do you think it is acceptable to bombard me with email on top of the email issue to make any real use of this app you have to sign up for the premium service wont be coming back uninstalled and you been added to my junk email list pathetic,1,2020-10-10 17:09:27,1,

starting out this app was ok but then i started noticing how limited this is for the free version only 10 projects and where did my completed tasks go those should not disappear until i manually delete them a week into using this and the workflow i was beginning to establish has been interrupted because my completed tasks are no longer showing up these are recurring tasks i do daily i don t know if this is normal for this app unless a task is specifically set for daily but it s lame,1,2020-09-14 06:15:17,30,"Hi David, thank you for the feedback!

the widget was finally perfect so of course someone had to make it less functional because obviously a 3x2 widget tucked away in a corner of the home screen isn t a thing that a person should be allowed to have no clearly only a widget that s required to take up more than half the screen will do is there seriously a good reason the widget can t be resized to something sensible any more because i can t think of one and i am seriously frustrated,2,2020-06-11 08:18:02,5,"Hi David, we will share your feedback with the team."

i am trying to find a decent replacement for wunderlist todoist is merely okay i m vacillating between 2 and 3 stars because the most common thing i need to do always add a task to the top of a list is apparently not possible the most frustrating thing so far is that adding a new task adds it to the bottom of the list not at the top i never want this behavior adding a task at the bottom of the list means the new thing is lost from view and i have to manually rearrange the list on the web app you can control where to add a new item by using shift a but there is no preference to always do this there is also no way to do shift a that i ve found on the android app you have to create a task then manually move it to the top also sorting by date either doesn t work or sorts the wrong way because the newest tasks are still at the bottom i cannot believe that this is the default behavior and that it cannot be set in a user preference i sooooo miss wunderlist,2,2020-04-15 21:14:14,0,"Hi Tracey, thank you for the feedback!

every update have been a step backwards all the small changes only made everything less convenient and looks like will only continue to do so the last straw for me is now you can t add things quickly to default inbox project anymore now you have to spend several more clicks to designate a project even though i just want to add quickly to the default inbox making the quick add widget useless now also premium pricing has always been terrible and greedy monthly cost instead of one time,2,2019-10-30 17:37:17,23,Sorry to hear that :( We're planning to improve the app in future updates.
the premium version might be good but the free version is more restricted then other to do apps you can not even use the labels tags function without paying if you are looking for a free todo list this is probably not the app for you,2,2019-10-28 06:09:41,3,
guys you created a great app that i d been using for years but the latest update is weird modal views when selecting a single task why do i need it instead of previous submenu for rescheduling no ability to choose multiple tasks only by top menu select tasks strange icons that all makes me really sad rolled out to the previous friendly todoist,2,2019-10-28 03:24:15,6,"Maxim, sorry to hear that, we'll consider improving the task detail view in the future.

sep 2013 took almost 1 year for decent reminders is still annoying to click twice to view the notes not very productive oct 2019 with new interface the notes disappeared the interface is just a copy of wunderlist or ticktick what is the point of paying a subscription when the competition offers the same functionality reminders and notes for nothing,2,2019-10-26 02:20:48,5,"Sorry to hear that, we'll look into improving the interface in future updates."

great app that suffers from the most annoying design flaw every time i create a task it goes to the bottom of the list i always want the task at the top so i can see it that s the whole point of using a to do list so i have to drag the task one by one to the top makes me crazy,2,2019-09-13 13:23:24,1,"Guillermo, sorry to hear that.

almost every feature requires a premium account for 36 per year it s not even possible to test these features without subscribing to an annual plan,2,2019-09-07 16:32:16,5,

seems like a good tool but almost nothing that i actually need to do with it is possible without a subscription i d happily puchase the app or do a free trial period but honestly it annoys me when companies offer a free download only to put everything useful behind a paywall especially when they try to give a discount for a year s sub before you even really get to try the features nope,2,2019-08-29 10:17:30,319,

i tried the free version i liked the way that you are writing the day to remind you and it set itself but the free version doesn t support calendar and for me this is a big minus i prefer to use google task app that signs up with calendar and reminds you for the task,2,2019-08-03 16:10:21,0,

i used to like this app been using it for a few years with tolerably okay results but it s been having too many problems with sync and with failing to load karma data not only that but if you miss checking a box but don t see that omission until the next day there s nothing you can do about it maybe the fatal flaw of this app is that it has too many features for its own good i d like to get rid of sync entirely and just use the app on my android but apparently that can t be done and if i delete my online account i delete everything i think i just want to dump this flawed app and see if i can find a good app that does everything offline in one device with no registration required,2,2019-07-30 08:03:56,0,

some pretty basic standard features in other apps are missing the options menu is very limited with no option to default a tasks due date project category etc these have to be entered every single time a task is created which makes adding quick tasks on the fly very annoyingly slower than other apps there is no sorting options or filters on views ability to create custom views does not exempt this feature from being useful too many clicks to edit tasks eg notes comments rescheduling,2,2019-07-12 11:17:09,15,"Daniel, thanks a lot for your feedback, we'll consider adding such options and improvements in the future."

awful ux ui i don t like how you have to use a rigid syntax to set recurrence for tasks i like old fashioned controls but todoist is just trying to be different for no reason was on premium for several months and gave it a fair shot needless to say i cancelled my subscription and switched to ticktick instead i don t normally downvote apps but this just didn t do it for me and i spent money on it i should have ignored the hype so the fault is mine,2,2019-07-03 04:07:38,0,Sorry to hear that.

mostly good but simply things like creating subtasks are incredibly fiddly why can you do it from only projects why can you only do it by long pressing and dragging slightly to the right to much marks is completed allow a simple option on the menu deleting tasks is several options in etc doing almost anything other than straight adding tasks is cumbersome as hell and just frustrating needs some real ux love,2,2019-07-02 03:15:22,2,"Gareth, thank you for your feedback, we're already working on improvements for the UI and UX so we hope you'll like the app more once the changes roll out :)"

beautiful interface and design unfortunately most features are locked behind a subscription including some important features such as viewing completed daily tasks as is other top rated to do apps offer more features for absolutely no cost would consider paying a one time fee for it but the subscription is a deal breaker,2,2019-06-25 11:06:09,12,

it s clear to me that this is the best todo app and i ve used it for a long time but having reminders be a premium feature is just unreasonable as it s impossible to use a todo app without them i ll be switching to ticktick,2,2019-06-01 15:00:12,0,

the splash screen says the account is free forever but to have reminder of events tasks a fairly fundemental aspect to a task reminder app its 3 per month that s quite misleading response to the developer thank you for responding the main point is that a reminder function is a key aspect of a to do list rather than a premium feature best wishes with the app,2,2019-05-27 17:00:09,10,"Scopio, the app is indeed free forever, you'll never have to pay to use it.

lost half its use once they got rid of seeing children categories in the widget i use todoist for homework assignments and i used the parent functions for assignments to categorize what class the assignment is for without being able to see all my parent sub folders from the widget it kills most of the use of the app i went back to an old apk but then i started getting prompts that the app would stop working if i didn t update i still use it as a grocery list with ifttt until keep is fixed,2,2019-05-22 19:11:48,3,

removing features from the free version is not a good way to attract people to premium version and the price is way to high looking elsewhere,2,2019-03-02 20:47:58,1,
would be better if the inbox was not treated as a project but rather a scheduling location and that items could be created in the inbox and easily bulk moved to other projects but stay in the inbox to then be scheduled to daily or next week or whatever tracking would be easier and the app would get a higher rating and i may actually subscribe its a deal breaker for me,2,2019-02-27 21:56:20,0,"Thomas, sorry to hear that. Please note that all that can already be done with filters.

i tried out this app but decided not to go with it because it wasn t as intuitive as i like and might be missing some features imagine my annoyance to receive a reminder email this morning when i specifically turned off all notification settings this app is probably great for people who like to be nagged i don t i like to be organized,2,2019-02-27 17:48:41,0,"Sorry to hear that.

very good functionality but let down visually i m not sure why you can change the colour of everything accept the task itself when you use the widget the only way to color tasks on the same list is by setting the priority which changes the tick circle color but is limited to 3 colours there s no way to change the colour of the text or background you can add a label but that does little to influence the look of the actual task very odd also on the widget cannot remove the today text,3,2020-09-21 04:04:36,14,"Hi Shaun, could you please submit a ticket regarding this accessibility feedback?

the concept is good and it s really helpful to have project tabs however it s really confusing when your completed tasks simply disappear it makes your progress really difficult to track also the subscription price is really expensive it would be better if it was a one time paymenr for full access to the features much like nova launcher i hope to see these changes made so i can support this app knowing i got my money s worth,3,2020-05-24 21:58:31,38,

coming from wunderlist this is the best one i found there is one thing which i find irritating the added item goes to the bottom of the list can you add an option to sort by reverse date that would make it perfect list for me,3,2020-05-21 10:29:10,1,Thank you for the feedback! This has been noted.
a nice solid basic app for tasks i enjoy the features of being able to have different projects priorities and easy scheduling the push notification doesn t seem to work unless i ve recently opened the app so usually i get a notification of the day s tasks after i ve already opened the app to check manually i m on a huawei android that s a big minus unfortunately,3,2020-05-18 01:46:38,0,"Hi, do you allow the app to run in the background?

simple clear unobstrusive but alignment and form of edited note does not mirror that of the saved note in the task list view,3,2020-05-11 22:17:20,0,
charging every task,3,2020-05-11 21:21:42,0,
an app that makes you pay for something for a feature as trivial as reminders cannot be considered as an usable free app,3,2020-05-06 18:45:06,1,
if i select sort by date i want it to be automatic so i do not need to re sort items if i mark task done or add new task,3,2020-05-02 12:11:42,0,"This has been noted, Juha. Thank you for the suggestion!"
i used to like this app because it was like writing in a physical notebook but that smooth user experience is gone i feel like they are focusing too much on adding new stuff while the core functionality gets looked over,3,2020-04-29 14:23:57,0,"This has been noted, Viktória. Thank you for the feedback."
the app itself is great it syncs with the echo to get your tasks without an audible reminder of tasks though it s not really any use and to get reminders is 3 quid a month,3,2020-04-26 16:04:47,0,
pretty good but too expensive,3,2020-04-25 06:55:10,0,
still trying it out,3,2020-04-24 15:27:39,0,
app has a lot of features unfortunatelly many not free of charge,3,2020-04-24 12:28:55,0,
shouldn t have to pay for reminders,3,2020-04-23 13:51:22,1,
clunky for my purposes seemed like a good reminder app i needed a list app i wanted something i could use to save a grocery list not something that tells me hey it s tuesday time to go to the grocery there s not a way to do that here without navigating too many menus i m coming from wunderlist so i am used to having direct and clean access to a group of to do lists todoist hides your lists in favor of showing you upcoming tasks and reminders i already have a calendar for that,3,2020-04-21 21:21:06,15,
this has been my favorite to do app for years but suddenly the badge app has stopped working on my note 10 if i don t quickly find a way to resolve this i ll be looking for another list solution,3,2020-04-18 21:21:24,0,"Hi Shelley, sorry to hear this. Could you please send us more details at support@todoist.com?"
reasonably decent to do list but the yearly fee is too high for what this product actually provides,3,2020-04-17 02:02:00,0,
ok not as easy to add a project after task has been entered a little clunky moving task to next day,3,2020-04-16 07:16:54,0,
more steps to go through to access lists that were immediately available on wunderlist,3,2020-04-15 23:27:10,0,
it s fine the widget does not allow for refreshing and the auto refresh never happens quickly enough if at all if there was a way to get to the app from the widget it would be whatever but you have to go find the app to go into it which is the app definitely has it s uses i m sure but i have to uninstall because we use the widget and if it s not functional it doesn t work for us,3,2020-04-15 18:21:50,14,"Hello, would you be able to contact us at support@todoist.com about this widget issue?"
mainly making use of tasks the sub tasks within make my day,3,2020-04-14 21:18:04,0,
the new widget made the app almost unusable for me not being able to refresh the tasks from widget and the lost app icon from widget might push me to find alternatives unless there is a new update on the way,3,2020-04-14 15:18:39,0,"Hi, we will bring back the Todoist icon shortcut in the upcoming version :)"
looks good but is for me worthless without notifications and then 3 4 per month in order to activate notifications is way too much maybe 1 could have been worth in order to move away from microsoft s free todo app,3,2020-04-09 02:54:22,2,
former version of the app i tried several task manager services before settling on this one lots of good features without unnecessary frills update as of april 2020 so disappointed unfortunately todoist didn t know how to leave something alone that wasn t broken and added unnecessary frills the functionality has become too layered and cumbersome what used to be done in any easy couple of taps now takes many steps my time is too valuable to jump through the hoops they have created to add and reschedule tasks after years of paying for the premium and being one of their top users i am in the market for a replacement there has to be something that is more efficient out there,3,2020-04-07 08:27:13,3,"Hi Polly, sorry to hear this. Would you be able to clarify the details at support@todoist.com?"
loved todoist but the new widget is a massive step backward for me can t multiselect and reschedule multiple tasks anymore,3,2020-04-05 15:23:39,2,"Hi Pranav, thank you for the feedback! This has been noted."
it was essential to me until the last updates,3,2020-04-04 06:05:05,0,"Hi Paulo, sorry to hear this! Could you tell us what made you decide this?"
this app is ok the thing that makes it stand out for me is that i ve been able to set it up to work with google home as my grocery and to do list however since the update i now can t click into the full app from the widget which is necessary as i m unable to rearrange my tasks from the widget and i can t seem to find a way so that the app automatically sorts my tasks by priority i can only see how to do it afterwards,3,2020-04-01 12:53:17,28,"Hi Emily, thank you for the feedback! We will bring back the icon to open the app very soon!"
not sure yet about other features but definitely need the ability to access the full app from the widget,3,2020-04-01 08:02:01,1,"Hi Kelly, we will bring this back very soon!"
i use todoist every day and it is awesome service in general but the latest update to the widget made it absolutely unusable for me it has too slim lines even without compact mode compact is ridiculous even though i have small fingers the quick button to open the main app is gone and the worst it is now not possible to select more tasks and do anything quick with them bye bye fast rescheduling i am greatly upset it is my main tool for staying on track,3,2020-04-01 03:52:08,13,"Hi Tereza, thank you for the detailed feedback. As for the icon to open the app, it will be added very soon :)"
great app but the update has ruined the functionality of the widget i can no longer figure out how to select multiple tasks and it is no longer possible to go straight to the app from the widget these are to important features for quickly making more complex changes to your schedule the widget could be improved otherwise the app is great,3,2020-03-31 12:50:25,26,"Hello, thank you for the suggestions! As for the shortcut icon to open the app, we will soon implement it back!"
great app but whin i installed it and tried the basic feature which is the reminder it doesn t avaliable thats mean you cant also try the reminder i appreciate that becouse no one will give you his work as a free ok i will give it less than 4 becouse i didnt see the main feature which i need,3,2020-03-31 11:19:23,0,
i can no longer touch the widget to open the full app what happened i use to be able to touch the upper left hand corner of the widget and the list would open in full screen,3,2020-03-31 03:06:54,2,"Hi Jodi, we will implement this back very soon!"
generally pretty good but a lot of awkward design choices no compact mode inefficient use of colors for organization difficulty selecting and moving tasks lack of icon consistency preset snooze and reminder time options rather than being able to choose them yourself,3,2020-03-27 21:02:46,3,"Hi Anna, thank you for the feedback! Could you please send us more details at support@todoist.com?"

i d be fine with paying 10 or 20 for this app i m not fine with paying 3 a month forever to continue using it without being able to use reminders on the free version it s no more useful than a 5 pocket calendar and i m not willing to pay what they re asking,3,2020-03-10 21:39:27,3,
really great app but it sucks that you have to get premium to get the most basic feature notifications for a timed reminder,3,2020-03-10 04:27:56,0,
a few major issues 1 the addition of sections in projects is nice but not useful if they only appear in project view but not filters 2 the sections cannot be reordered to appear at the top of a list the can only be at the end of a task list 3 in filtered view pulling subtasks out of their parent task or non completable tasks is ludicrous duplicating them like that is silly at best,3,2020-03-03 06:56:20,0,Please contact support@todoist.com about this issue and include the exact query of your filter so we can try to reproduce it under the same circumstances.

eu amo este aplicativo e uso sincronizado com o meu google calendar porem de um tempo para cá mesmo com a configuraçao para manter no google calendar as tarefas ja executadas no todolist o evento do google calendar some podem verificar era muito importante pra mim que os eventos continuassem no google calendar minha versao nao é premium e estava pensando em comprar estou com medo de comprar e continuar assim obrigada,3,2020-01-30 18:45:30,0,"Oi Yasmin!

layout and appearance is good but main features like alarm reminder etc are available only in premium version,3,2020-01-20 01:50:41,0,
being a free version user regularly i can boast about todoist s opening yield of tools you receive although they are not much different or more varied than most other task apps what makes todoist stand out is the easy to operate platform the simplicity mixed with the intuitive functionality makes this a hair more effective enjoyable my recommendation for anyone needing some help being more structured it helped me greatly,3,2020-01-18 06:47:12,0,
i wish more options be available to free version,3,2020-01-17 00:36:39,0,

excellent with a single exception i ve used todoist for about 5 years and it s the best app in its class the free version outperforms other paid apps in my experience the one thing holding it back for me is the home screen widget on my phone it struggles to load lags is unresponsive won t select tasks properly the list may well go on in short there are so many things which sometimes break it rarely works this is fundamental 5 stars if fixed til then it s a reluctant 3,3,2020-01-05 10:17:45,6,"Thanks for the feedback, we’re working on an improved app widget and it should be available in beta soon :)"
it s good but i don t like how it makes me feel bad for how unproductive i am but that s just me nothing against the program,3,2020-01-02 11:27:00,0,We’d rather want to make you feel productive!

looks very appealing and has support on multiple platforms however having basic push notification for individual tasks behind a pay wall is pretty stupid and makes it the app untempting to switch to i would reconsider if the paywall wasn t a subscription or rather have the reminders as a separate one time purchase,3,2019-12-21 14:15:07,79,
android widgets don t work anymore clicking on done circle but nothing updates only by restarting the phone removing and re adding widget to screen uninstalled,3,2019-12-19 13:08:54,2,
the app is good and i ve switched to it from ticktick but then i switched to microsoft todo because of the design mainly but that s not the only thing don t get me wrong it works but there are way to many features that are premium at least make the reminders a free feature because that is just absurd maybe fix the design add an all black theme and make the reminders a free feature but all in all it s great,3,2019-12-14 23:45:02,0,

i recently downloaded this app and paid for the premium subscription i like the app but i have two issues that are hindering its functionality the first is that the notifications slate quite buggy i have 3 different daily tasks which i ve set to notify me when they start and i only receive my notifications sometimes the second is that my workweek is sunday thursday and i found out after speaking with their support that there is no option to set a non standard workweek,3,2019-11-23 10:51:41,3,"Kristi, reg. notifications, please make sure that the app always runs in the background.

super app with horrible widget you can mistakenly complete a task by clicking on widget and it s gone without you even noticing it free apps have better widget honestly,3,2019-11-20 11:13:57,0,
its a to do list that can go everywhere with you and no writing can prioritize list as well great little app 11 2019 edit hoping like other folks that they undo the changes this app has gotten more difficult and counterintuitive with the last update used to be able to select multiple items to reschedule at one time can t do that anymore also used to be able to just type repeat everyday repeat every monday wednesday and friday etc it now seems like only sometimes that works,3,2019-11-18 08:35:49,6,"You can still multi-select tasks in two ways, either by using the ""Multi select"" option from the 3-dot menu at the top or by configuring the ""swipe to left"" gesture to multi-select. Recurring tasks still work when you enter them while adding the task, when editing it, you can use the scheduler, but we'll change this in a future update."
very long time user latest updates are making things harder subtasks in recurring parent tasks are now automatically archived when completed and don t seem to reappear when parent task is due again example i have a weekly todo titled groceries with grocery items i need to buy as subtasks within that recurring parent task whereas before i could mark a subtask as complete and expect that same subtask to reappear next time when i go shopping again it s now completely gone,3,2019-11-17 07:06:00,5,

im in love with this app however being forced to pay for the premium service on my device my husband s device for just notification feels a little bit wrong i think for something like a to do list notification should not be a premium feature there is an amazing amount of functionality in this app and i have been through dozens of different to do it apps over the years and by far this is my favorite it is so clean simple easy to use and it does recurring todos,4,2020-09-29 05:56:00,119,

almost perfect with a lot on my mind and a million projects up in the air todoist does almost everything i need it to do it s the best option out there so far but i wish i could use it as my only to do app would need the ability to not have completed tasks move to the bottom of their section but stay in their original order have new tasks appear at the top of the inbox list toggle to swipe only to complete accidental checking see a percent complete number or visual for proj sect,4,2020-09-24 21:50:56,62,"Thank you for the detailed suggestions, Sarah!

amazing app definitely my to do app of choice wish it had a more robust calander view with a proper week view function it s also increasingly hard to justify the premium when free equivalents are getting so much better google s apple microsoft s and note taking apps are becoming better to do lists notion a big gripe for me is that its design ui is falling a little behind its competitors things 3 apple reminders which to me is almost the whole point of a todo app,4,2020-09-13 05:52:00,19,"Hi Chris, thank you so much for the detailed feedback!

this is a great to do list app however the competition offers a lot of features for free which are premium here this app should offer atleast reminder functionality for free maybe they can limit the amount of reminders and projects that you can get in the free version which might make it a compelling app right now in the free version you can just create lists and projects which are viewable in the widgets but a reminder should be there even in the basic version,4,2020-07-01 15:34:17,22,
very simple to do list app simple but quite powerful even on the free plan there are a lot of other apps that offer more stuff for free but they are clunky to use the only problem i have is inability to hide things that are only available with the premium subscription such as labels and filters tabs but i understand why they re there,4,2020-06-30 20:17:15,14,

good for keeping lists of tasks and working through them it is worth taking time to learn the different ways to use and organise the app sometimes it seems to be working against me eg in certain views i can t drag tasks up and down a list or can t see them ordered by subject edit follows to respond to todoist s reply thanks for replying yes as you say sorting in filtered views is not possible or to use non developer language ugghhh why can t i sort this list by project or in another way that suits me this is the one thing that i dislike strongly about an otherwise excellent app wunderlist had better sorting and tick tick has it i would love to see this change in todoist,4,2020-06-23 02:27:31,11,"Hi Helen, yes, this is something that we are looking into now :( For now, you may want to create some custom filtered views to show tasks from certain projects, for example."

loved ticktick great interface and the widget was perfect unfortunately i had to move on to todoist ticktick doesn t have alexa capabilities and that s a deal breaker for a while ifttt and gmail provided a good workaround but recent changes to gmail rendered that functionality inoperable ticktick get on board with alexa and i ll come back,2,2019-12-15 03:58:14,0,"Hi, the team has been working on developing the integration with Alexa now, it will go live soon."

i downloaded and paid for this app several days ago it has some good aspects but now i literally hate some other aspects of it for example if you set a specific time for a specific time e g 1 3 pm it disapears without giving you a chance to do anything with it so if you didn t finish that task you are out of luck if you want to move it to somewhere else how ridiculous it is i m really scared i can t trust this tool i have to switch to something else and cut my losses,2,2019-12-03 10:58:28,1,"Dear User,

disappointing i have been happily using this application for years now but the last few updates appear to have caused more problems than they fixed one example when you create an event that s further away than a month the app will at all times change the date and time to incorrect ones it has done this each time for me over the last months changing the dates and times for no reason you can imagine this is a deal breaker for a planning app,2,2019-11-14 18:15:03,46,"Hey! The issue is preliminary estimated to do with the ending of DST. Could you please check if the newly added task are displayed correctly?
So sorry for interrupting the time setup! The previous task time may not be restored automatically. But we will add a fixed timezone option in future updates in case the issue happens again."

best to do list app except the new notifications have gone haywire they only pop up at bottom of screen and then disappear if i open any other app old standard android notifications would remain in pull down notification drawer until i dealt with it far superior please bring that back,2,2019-10-30 07:48:26,3,Noted.

Could you please write us to support@ticktick.com and include the exact steps you did before the issue? We will take a further look into it asap.
has been one of the best reminder app available for a long time this most recent update messed up notifications on android 10 they don t follow the system dark mode at all instead you have to manually change it in the app or deal with mismatched colors it looks ridiculous seeing a white notification background amidst other black backgrounds in dark mode it also looks like the black is not a true black like other apps if this isn t fixed soon i ll be looking for a new reminder app,2,2019-10-24 00:32:26,3,Thank you for your kind feedback. We are aware of it and we will do some tweaking in the future versions asap.
this is very good app but the monthly cost or yearly cost are not worth it for me i found a free app that does tbe same things,2,2019-10-23 04:27:54,0,
i really like this app it s one of the best reminder apps there is however the new custom notifications are horrible it sticks out like a sore thumb you have to manually set between white or black background which means that they don t automatically switch with android 10 dark mode they re also not black but grey which makes them look ugly next to other notifications title and time also don t line up with other notifications plus it says a min ago which is only accurate if i look at my phone immediately and it turns on the screen when the notification comes in even if it s in my pocket this is a great app but the recent update is one of those if it ain t broken don t fix it moments i really hope you consider going back to standard android notifications or at least provide an option between custom or standard i ll gladly update my review to 5 stars if that happens,2,2019-10-21 07:14:02,13,"Your feedback has been passed to the product team, we will evaluate and make some improvements in the future."
the new notifications are useless to me i always keep my phone on vibrate and the old normal android notification would vibrate my phone and notify me on my watch too but now the new notification pops up silently and is very easy to miss and i ve tried changing the settings and nothing works i really don t understand why not use android s build in notifications instead of this new thing or why is there no option to turn it off,2,2019-10-21 02:01:20,9,Hey Patrick! Thanks for your feedback! The devs will look into it asap.
i would ve switched to ticktick but there is no option to change to a 12 hour setting from a 24 hour,2,2019-10-20 09:10:41,0,We appreciate your feedback! We will consider adding it in the future versions.
a very good to do manager i would take a premium version if on the windows version it would possible to set change manage location reminders for this feature i already wait some years i m really surprised that the programmers are not able to add this feature also at the windows app it s annoying so anoying that you have to edid every task in android again to add a location reminder but it seems to be to difficult for the programmers so when this is to difficult what can we expect will the maintanance of the windows app stay on a reliable basis waiting already since years for a change didn t know why the ask me to change settings on android to change place reminders on my windows ticktick may be i should give up 18 10 2019,2,2019-10-18 20:45:53,1,"Hi Wolfgang, Sorry for the inconvenience.

honestly the premium version is just not worth it what s the point of having advanced calendar views and event setup and calendar import if in every case you can t see future recurring events the next event in the list of recurring appears only if you have ticked off the previous instance in order to use a calendar efficiently for planning you ought to see what events are next this hindrance has been made present by the users as far as 2015 as i m seeing online and nothing has been done that not only shows poor hindsight what s a calendar without planning but also a strikingly deaf customer service the app is probably just as good as its free version the pomodoro timer is ok but the extra features are just not worth the expense for the premium version,2,2018-11-04 05:04:59,2,Sorry for the inconvenience.

bizarre task app you add a task and then tap some strange icons like tags etc that seem to do nothing in particular then you send it to an inbox for reasons unknown you then have to click through two more screens to tap it again just to add a reminder and set the time to make all that official there s a tiny check at the top of the screen to tap then nothing really no confirmation or summary nothing you have to double check that you got it right also updates do nothing laborious,3,2020-09-09 07:00:28,7,"Thanks for the feedback. Actually, when you add a task, the icons are used to quick add reminders and date, priority, tag and list for it. You don't have to go through more screens to set them.

i noticed a slight anomaly in the app if you start focus for a subtask e g subtaskx of taskx then why isn t that focus time added to the total time of taskx that subtaskx does fall under the taskx so any time invested in subtaskx should also be added into the main taskx otherwise it defeats the whole purpose of subtaskx if it is independent of the taskx i hope you will focus on this issue thanks edit1 the app has a lot of useful features but they are often hard to find simplify it,3,2020-08-10 06:14:09,0,

calendar integration is okay but buggy and quirky can t see calendar events in daily view without changing settings to show in all lists organize view can t use custom lists to plan my week the sync with google is unforgivably poor if i change a calendar event it takes up to a day to reflect in ticktick this is so bad i have begun looking for replacement i would like to see a better support forums for community feedback often answers are basically suck it up that s just the way it is,3,2020-05-17 16:04:45,5,
so close to being my dream todo app it claims to support start times but actually doesn t you can record the start and due time but you can t then filter a list to only show a task that has in fact started i e what can i work on now for me this makes start times nothing more than a tag that i can t interact with which totally defeats the point,3,2020-05-17 13:16:14,17,

ticktick is not a bad app by any means but it is too complicated for my needs so i just went back to using google keep which also has an excellent sync system with its website equivalent ticktick is especially complex when it comes to the scheduling of alerts which always confused me to the point where i didn t understand how to set the reminders that i wanted ticktick is a fantastic app but it is quite confusing i prefer simplicity in the note taking and reminder apps that i use,3,2020-04-17 21:32:24,10,

has the potential to be an excellent all in one calendar and to do list however i cancelled my subscription two weeks in as 1 subtasks automatically repeat when repeating main task is completed regardless of time and due date settings this should be optional 2 subtask reminders should be optional 3 calendar functions are very limited e g ability to set up an event rather than a task would be a valuable addition,3,2020-04-03 18:14:03,3,

i love the ability to see my to do items synced with my google cal that way i can drag my tasks to whenever i want and plan my day out the only reason i m giving the app 4 stars is because recurring google calendar events show up multiple times in the same day on the calendar view i contacted their customer support they responded sorry there is no setting for that but i will note it down as a feature request to our product team for future consideration it s not a setting it s a bug,4,2020-09-17 09:30:50,62,

i ve been using ticktick for probably 4 years and it s the best to do list app out there it s simple and straightforward and i love that i can have it on all of my devices and computer and keep one to do list wherever i go i would love to give it 5 stars but over the last few months it s been very glitchy with syncing between my various devices,4,2020-06-23 01:01:38,0,
i definitely recommend it,4,2020-06-22 20:24:17,0,
great better than todoist cause you can organize how you want in inbox or all view despite priority or reminder time that option is what sets it above wish that android reminders were full screen however or that snooze reminders could be optionabke for time view in website and windows app also could be draggable for left to right sizing of columns,4,2020-06-21 21:14:40,3,
great app but i would like to see todo s within todo s i mean like when u click a todo it should open more sub todo s then i surely give you 5 stars,4,2020-06-21 20:59:15,0,

it s really good app i have been using it for few days really helpful just one thing when i add a new task it shows up on the top of existing tasks can i change the settings so that it will appear at the bottom that s why given 4 stars,4,2020-06-12 09:42:51,0,
this app is amazing very convenient to be honest everything is just there for u to setup the interface looks simple but great especially the dark theme i love it one main thing about this app is that the premium section of it does not overwhelm the user it s there but it doesn t shovel itself to the users face compared to the others i ve used this is a better deal,4,2020-06-11 06:24:17,18,
i really like it the reason i m giving a 4 star is that i wish the focus promo could be set for more than 120 mins 120 mins means i ve got to keep changing it againg and againg for longer focus periods which breaks the focus p s i m using the free version i don t know whether it available on the premium version or not,4,2020-06-10 22:25:40,1,

absolutely amazing a simple design that allows you to organize your task into a list that you can format however you want and see on your phone computer or android wear the only reason i give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the syncing between devices is a little bit inconvenient often i would make changes to my tasklist on my phone and they would not show up on computer until i went back into the app and manually refreshed it,4,2020-06-07 02:02:55,22,
i like the fact that you can put some tasks for everyday and you can classify the tasks by list but i would rather if it can give me my productivity rate after every week month based on the number of tasks completed,4,2020-06-06 06:31:01,0,

had some weird hiccups and things to first figure it out but got it going smoothly love the option to share todo lists and the integration with other calendars stand alone web version also good widget isn t great but all around a very solid app no intrusive ads and a robust free version that is still worth using it you don t want to pay the monthly fee highly recommend trying it out,5,2020-10-28 00:19:34,0,

premium version is the best calendar app i could find i tried to avoid paying and spent a long time reading reviews but for all apps something crucial was missing from free version in this case calendar integration with google didn t sync properly so i switched to the premium version so i can use ticktick as my only calendar if you re trying to use free version this is pretty annoying it s cheap though slightly cheaper than the main competitor todoist so i m fine with paying,5,2020-10-17 20:17:25,16,

since joining their very affordable monthly subscription i ve found ticktick to be an indispensable part in my daily routine and it s actually helping me be more productive even though i m a pretty begrudging procrastinator first off the widgets god i love the widgets the first thing i see after unlocking my phone is a a list of all the stuff i need to be doing on that given day and b a cute visual checklist of daily habits that i need to also make time for this was what i found was missing back when i used the todoist app was a simple means of having both habits and to dos living in the same shared ecosystem i suppose there are technically more dedicated habit apps with deeper tracking features but what s here is perfectly functional and easily integrates into your regular inbox today lists the widgets update dynamically right along with the full screen app and also with the pc and web integrations this was a must have feature because i ve tried other productivity apps where there is lag time between inputs on the widget and seeing them refreshed into existence several minutes later in the app itself ticktick makes everything instant to the point that a ticktick notification pings on my phone at the precise moment it also pings on my laptop i really can t understate how useful the widget and cross platform integration is because for someone like me who procrastinates a lot and forgets what i m meant to be doing at any random moment it s so useful to just open up my phone and instantly have my most important tasks habits slap me in the face demanding my attention this also ties in nicely with the way notifications alerts work i ve got reminders set on all my habits and when the reminders go off they actually take over the entire screen at which point i can tick them off or dig into the more extensive options on the back end there s a few areas i can see for quality of life improvements though i m optimistic that their subscription model means we haven t seen the final iteration of this app for some time yet a few things that jump out at me over a couple months usage to mark a habit as incomplete you can t just double tap the checkbox for an x mark you have to open the app pull up the relevant habit in the dashboard go into its settings and the option is buried all the way in the app s back end menus it s a minor gripe but when compounded over weeks or months of use it s easy to just not bother marking your failures at all it makes me wonder if there s other useful features i ve missed just because they re not readily accessible on the front end ui widgets it would be nice if habits displayed in the widget front end ui had a visual indicator of how many days that habit has been on streak for you can track those metrics but again it s hidden in the robust yet opaque back end accessible via sub menus and abstract graphs rather than being loudly displayed front and centre i d probably be more motivated to keep the streak going with a given habit if i could see at a split second glance how today s efforts fit into the context of the previous 7 days or whatever also you can set habits to only repeat on certain days of the week or a certain number of times per week but again its not really visible at a quick glance to know if you re on track or falling behind by which i mean when i pull up my habits for thursdayy for instance and i see exercise at gym in my list of habits for that day then surely i should get some indication of you ve been to the gym x times this week so far and you have y gym sessions remaining for this week in order to fulfil your habitual obligations again the information is there in the app but you have to actively seek it out maybe the more fastidious time keepers will see to this without batting an eye but for forgetful adhd prone types like myself if it s not right in front of me then it might as well not exist but all in all these are minor foibles fantastic app 5 5,5,2020-10-04 08:54:17,91,

really good app both when it comes to managing tasks and tracking habits it supports language input when creating tasks such as every monday it also has a few useful widgets for the home screen only bad thing about this app is that you have to pay if you want to get access to all features but it s not that expensive and the app is really good even without premium so that s why it still gets five stars from me,5,2020-10-01 21:13:23,22,
the description didn t tell me that filters were premium when it listed premium features edit maybe saying something like ticktick premium features include the following and more would be more clear thanks for the reply,5,2020-10-01 13:39:28,0,"Hi Kelly, it's a little hard for us to cover all Premium features here, but we have noted down your suggestion.

updated review i have used this app for half a year against my better judgement i have sent eighteen bug reports to the devs little i could easily send another twenty more but it isn t worth the time this is simply the most bugged piece of software i have ever used the avatars are hideous the only good thing that this app has going for it is the clean user interface and a clever separation of the to do list into three sections it is missing some pretty basic to do list functionality the game loads slowly and doesn t work without an internet connection some of the bugs i ve experienced reminders pop up on random days no matter how many times i readjust their settings constantly having trouble connecting to the servers visual bugs shows one item but you get some other item newly equipped main weapon won t show on avatar until app restarted progress bars for quests spaz out every time you open the page keyboards won t go away once they pop up and the list goes on and on,1,2018-10-25 02:59:37,2,"Hi Jerome, thanks for your feedback, it's very helpful for us.

it takes too long to be fun and sets you up for failure at the start you are asked to create a small of tasks however the number of tasks you do is directly related to how fast you level and a few tasks means it takes a long time to get to level 10 which is when you finally get to pick a class however you could level faster if you add more tasks but doing that before you are ready will set you up to fail this is not discouraged as it should be and there few goals at lower levels,2,2020-05-18 09:53:10,0,"Hi j-Sun, thank you so much for this thoughtful review.

despite various updates to fix bugs the first few screens of this app are still completely broken on android the app beyond sign in still functions but that s it the game aspect is weak the app isn t very well designed and the tutorials tend to be broken on android as well i prefer apps like fabulous which i think approaches the subject of mental health and habit forming in a much better way,2,2020-02-14 20:22:53,1,"Hi Cameron, thank you so much for this thoughtful review.

good app but very buggy and support is completely unhelpful there s no way to change your subscription level in the app or play store even if you cancel the app will think you re still subscribed so basically when you pick a subscription level you are fully committed to it because the devs are too incompetent and uncaring to help when using a choosing skill the habits n dailies show up like 10 of the time and the devs basically said oh well we can t fix that when i mentioned it,2,2020-02-02 22:33:18,23,"Hi Alex, we're very sorry to hear you had this experience.

i like the concept because i ve been trying to gamify my free time for a while assigning a predifined score to each habit practiced the most during every hour and all i wanted was the positive and the negative habits to affect the same progress bar with the possibility to keep track of a daily score with a possibly negative value it s a damn shame but this aint for me i wish it was more customisable,2,2020-02-02 04:18:14,8,"Hi Aharon, thank you so much for this thoughtful review.

would you quit directing me to the website if i want to join a party guild it should be done on the app it won t let me log in on the site at all why you people would choose to have it so if you use log in using google it resets and begins a whole new account without asking now i have two accounts on one email it won t even give me my password i tried resetting it several times how annoying bad design after i spent so much time on the app too all for it not to work,2,2019-12-11 01:55:43,6,"Hi This is Fallacious, we apologize for the inconvenience.

need wifi data for it i get that you can play with your friends but it would be nice if i could use it without wifi for data anyway i have a limited ammout of data and brain memory so by the time i get home after all day i ve forgotten my habits and the point becomes mute only gave this an extra star because i love the 8 bit art,2,2019-11-25 22:55:22,0,
the idea is wonderful but a lot of tedious mistakes spoil the whole impression for example information is slowly updated even within the application often clicking on a menu item is ignored if you create a task without a title but with a list it will become closed for editing just delete not all things are obvious i had to read help to solve simple questions well the old school 8 bit graphics not everyone likes it,2,2019-11-22 05:07:05,3,"Hi Eugene, thank you so much for this thoughtful review.

great concept but really quite bad execution with so many bugs even in the new player introduction it feels like an early access not v2 2 of anything surprised to learn that it s been in public release for 4 years now i would be ashamed to make or spend money from any transaction within this game i m not usually this harsh and i hope none of the devs take this review personally but get it together needs a major qol ux overhaul before i would consider the concept v1 0 complete,2,2019-10-18 17:51:34,60,"Hi Will, thank you so much for this thoughtful review.

i immediately encountered a problem when i began by misclicking on one of my habits there s no way to correct for that manually change the values yes but the xp and hp don t change to reflect that automatically secondly the settings page is broken on my s9 and the issue is difficult to describe the display freezes so if you scroll an instance of the text moves while the another is stuck below honestly the tutorial really needs work i could go on but space constraints,2,2019-10-10 04:45:00,1,"Hi Ed, thanks so much for this thoughtful review.

to be honest it s a really good app it has everything simplicity system ui etc but seriously if this is really a productivity app it needs to have an offline mode does it really need to have an internet connection every time someone has to check their to do list,2,2019-09-24 19:43:50,0,

this app is either really good or really bad broken there are no in betweens i love the concept and its super cute but it bugs out quite a bit and besides which is super easy to misclick on as a result i ve lost or accidentally lost items as well as accidentally spending nearly all of my coins completely on accident because there s no verification for buying and no refunding and that s besides the part where it constantly unequips all of my gear this game needs help,2,2019-09-10 02:34:45,1,"Hi Leolani, thanks for your review!

very nice and interesting concept but completely useless because you flipping need wifi to update your checklist furthermore even if my parents didn t control my wifi and i had full access there should be a way to see all your tasks etc at a glance without having to scroll so much also what s the point if you can just go in the settings and set the amount of money you want and a bunch of my friends joined habitica only to leave because it takes up too much time and it s not fun enough,2,2019-09-01 00:59:08,1,"Hi Snow Flake, thank you so much for this thoughtful review.

latest update has not fixes bugs that occur every day frustrating to use sometimes it won t save will just have a loading loop some basic things are not customizable like the calendar starting on monday or the date format doesn t keep track of activity data correctly please focus on getting the app to work instead of focusing on superficial appearance was thinking of paying for a subscription but what s the point if the money will not go towards making the app usable less temperamental,2,2019-07-02 08:35:13,1,"Hi m, thank you for your review and feedback.

needs a vpn if you re in china some questionable ui and design choices though the fundamentals work well for the most part if you want to do anything remotely interesting then you have to pay of course and the subscription fees are absolutely extortionate one month is the same price as a month of netflix and a year is 47 a year of ms office 365 with all of its functionality is 60 let that sink in i don t understand why for relatively little this app costs so much greed i assume,2,2019-05-07 07:34:20,3,"Hi Philip, thanks so much for this thoughtful feedback.

great concept but riddled with bugs sign up was horribly difficult with the servers not responding and the app failing to realize i was trying to change my username and display names app reset at around 7 00 pm instead of at midnight of my time zone which i had double checked beforehand i want to like it but this is becoming downright frustrating,2,2019-03-20 06:01:26,4,"Hi Rukia, sorry to hear about the trouble!

Sorry to hear about the trouble, and thank you for your review. You can help us fix issues like this by reporting them directly to the mobile team via Menu - About - Report a Bug."
incredible tool awful app i d recommend the desktop version of this site to anyone but the app is a bug ridden mess that overcomplicates simple functions and only works about 90 of the time,2,2019-01-24 04:34:06,142,
it s been really helpful for habit building but it s now bugging like crazy and crashing every time i open it so not wonderful,2,2019-01-22 20:12:38,3,
it s a great idea but it just doesn t work the pages never refresh for the next day and if i press the refresh button it just comes up with an unable to connect to server error or just stays with the loading symbol infinitely i went on it today after not going on it for a couple of days and i just find that im dead out of nowhere the refill health prompt kept repeatedly popping up and then when it stopped my health bar was still at zero also the add habit button isnt there always,2,2019-01-22 17:01:46,15,
the idea behind the app is nice but it isn t userfriendly finding and adding friends to use it together was so counter productive that it got us to waste time we could be actually doing our daily tasks,2,2019-01-21 06:28:38,0,
heres the thing i love this app and the idea behind it but for some reason its so dang glitchy pages wont always change when i scroll tasks dont refresh i often have to completely close the app help very willing to change this review to 5 stars if we get this figured out,2,2019-01-19 23:48:15,5,
i wanted to use this app the concept is really good but i won t use it simply because it barely functions for starters it s online only but as if that wasn t enough the sync on android is just all over the place the app would sometimes ask have you done these things today for tasks that were scheduled the day before or at 1 am for tasks on that day speaking of tasks i couldn t set up multiple repeating tasks for certain days of the week per task wanted to fill the whole week with various tasks and repeat them for some reason they would all sync to same weekdays i enabled reminders but never had a reminder come up once and as far as i researched online this is a common problem on android and hasn t been resolved for some time so it seems i have to create a habit of opening this habit tracker app,2,2019-01-16 15:03:55,0,
this app would be 100x better if it incorporated some of the editting customizing functions of the other to do list apps out there i want to be able to strike through each of the to do items and view deleted archived completed items be able to choose colors etc,2,2019-01-09 13:00:58,2,
the app is awesome but it made my phone drain 30 battery per day in the background which makes it useless,2,2018-12-12 03:30:04,0,

let s be honest here if you need help with basic habit management you won t use this regularly enough to help and if you re organized and have a good routine you don t need it a pointless novelty at best,2,2018-11-09 07:32:41,0,
clunky and very slow to load not fun at all just yet another task i had to deal with daily,2,2018-11-08 22:54:47,2,
several navigation options are inaccessible because they re underneath the home back tasks buttons at the bottom or within the notification notch area at the top making this app hard to use on my phone,2,2018-11-05 18:24:39,4,
the app was working fine until it started bugging out recently and showing me the wrong dailies going back to using just the website now until this is fixed,2,2018-11-05 08:01:40,2,
this app is a great idea with poor execution reminders only sometimes appear and the ui can be very unresponsive i ve checked daily tasks off only to find that the app interpreted this as unchecking the task since it hadn t registered the fact that it is a new day yet which actually subtracts the game resources from you these problems are significant enough to make the rpg like rewards system ineffective for me and the app not worth using as a habit tracker at this time sadly,2,2018-10-28 20:45:06,3,"Hi James, sorry to hear about the trouble and thank you for your feedback. If you'd like to send any bug reports directly to the team to help them diagnose and fix the issues you mentioned, you can do so via Menu- About - Report a Bug."
i m a breath away from uninstalling this app again half the time it doesn t even do what it s supposed to do some things it doesn t even let you do inside the app you have to go to the actual browser version to do it on that subject the mobile browser is beyond awkward no chance of navigating it properly if i m supposed to log into an actual pc just to check off that i did a workout or washed dishes forget it right now the only reward i get is having my good mood ruined certainly not worth it,2,2018-10-27 19:28:56,7,"Hi Sonja, sorry to hear about the trouble and thank you for your feedback.

the app itself is quite good but without offline mode it s useless for me,2,2018-10-25 19:55:45,0,
no landscape mode for tablets i like the browser version but landscape support is essential to me,2,2018-10-20 17:13:53,2,
this app would be so much better if it didn t penalize you for doing your habits for many days in a row instead of getting more experience coins you get less the longer you do something you should be rewarding the habits that people are building not telling them that once they have the habit they re going to get less for it otherwise this app would get five stars for me,2,2018-10-15 18:52:20,8,
it s a good app but it doesn t really work for me please provide an offline mode because not everyone has data and wi fi throughout the whole day i will rate it 5 stars once there is an offline mode,2,2018-10-05 16:58:04,19,
it s a great app really nice features does everything it says on the tin but let me tell you a productivity app won t do what it s meant to do unless it s usable offline i really loved using it but now i m going back to the good old bullet journal,2,2018-09-27 10:59:06,1,
i honestly didn t get much chance to use the app before it stopped connecting and not letting me do anything before that happened i started setting up daily tasks and the part where you set how often such as the days of the week you do each task was confusing i would change the days on one task and it would change it for all of them over all too much work for its worth loved the idea though it would have really gotten me doing things to level up and collect items,2,2018-09-26 06:25:24,4,"Hi Jenna, we had a server outage. We apologize for the inconvenience. The app should be working as normal now."
doesn t connect at all pls fix it,2,2018-09-26 06:05:21,2,"Hi Ed,  we had a server outage. We apologize for the inconvenience. The app should be working as normal now."
this app seemed very interesting until i got into the app and at the very start of it it made itself very clear that this app is geared towards women the avatar customization part all the hair and accessories were for women app seemed cool but unwelcoming for guys,2,2018-09-08 15:40:53,1,
the app s concept is very misleading i was promised gameplay and if it really is in here i m having a rough time finding it,2,2018-08-28 12:04:24,0,"Hi Swords Zenny! Thanks for your comments. Habitica is focused more on productivity than an actual ""game"" so it may not be the best fit for what you're looking for. Thanks for giving us a try!"
it s a great idea and i think i d really love it but it s unusable offline and as someone who doesn t have access to wifi all the time that makes it impossible to work with,2,2018-08-23 21:01:27,0,"Hi Meret, thanks for your review. We'd like to add an offline mode in the future but as we're a very small team this may take longer than updates for other apps you may be familiar with. Thanks for giving us a try!"
google login does not work for me in freshly instead app i can tap login with google button pop up asks me to pick a google account to use ipick the only one and i m left on an empty login register screen really tapping google login button does nothing i ve tried manually enabling phone and storage permissions manually clearing app data and cache reinstalling the app nothing worked,2,2018-08-18 12:30:44,1,
thought it was great until i opened the app to mark off a task only to find that i had died lost all my progress no idea how what is the point of having an app that gives you experience when you accomplish goals if you can lose it all without knowing why,2,2018-08-15 10:06:52,0,

excellent idea but poor execution there really isn t much to do game wise especially since the majority of the content is locked behind a paywall i understand that they have to monetize it but at 1 million users ad impressions may have been a better route instead of a subscription service that locks out the majority of your player base from the start there s also no way to earn crystals other than paying with so little to do and so much unavailable unless you pay with no options to try before you buy gives me little motivation to come back some advice make the quests you can buy with gold cheaper 200 coins takes forever to grind and there s not much to do otherwise have a way for f2p players to earn crystals maybe through daily login bonuses level up bonuses or grind and buy them with gold offline capabilities especially for checklists and tasks i shouldn t need the internet to check off my to do list have the ability to choose your class at the start and allow players to change class whenever they d like having to wait until you re level 10 is too much of a grind have a little more customization available from the start maybe a freeby starter egg or a background or outfit literally everything is locked behind crystal pay walls even the character backgrounds are a whopping 15 crystals that just screams greedy,2,2018-06-12 05:24:21,2,Hi Enrique! Thanks for your feedback! We appreciate the time you took to make this thoughtful write-up and will definitely pass your comments on to the team.
a fine app except for all the bugs any cosmetic aspirations you were hoping to have as a motivator character customization equipment colors and more all do not display not only that but an error message pops up every time i perform an action really hope they patch the bugs i dare not use anything else than the checklist,2,2018-06-07 11:41:19,3,"Hi Matt!

i really used to love this app but mobile push notifications stopped working there s been a ton of bugs lately and it s just not motivating like it used to be when i reported the bugs i was told to email someone instead and i m at a point where i just uninstalled maybe i ll return in a year or so,2,2018-05-24 19:03:38,0,"Hi Katy!

If you can send an email to mobile@habitica.com the devs can take a look and help you out!"
it s a gamified checklist which is a good start but ultimately not enough to follow through on the core idea there s no actual game here nothing to do and no true incentive to keep you coming back an upsetting amount of content is gated behind purchases and i found my interest waning once i ran out of things to look forward to also the fact that it takes until level 10 to be allowed to switch classes is insane,2,2018-05-19 09:54:53,3,"Hi Spencer! Thanks so much for your feedback, we'll pass it on to the team."
honestly it s kind of dull compared to the web version you should add more colors because the current interface is kind of bland i cheat with the mobile version but stay focused on the web needs some more effort and work being done the greatest thing about this is the parties and i love that you can use accounts but the android platform seems a bit inferior to the web version still like it though has some opportunity edit horrible on android trash absolutely trash great on web incompetent on mobile,2,2018-05-13 19:38:02,0,"Hi Darren, Sorry to hear about the trouble.

unfortunately i keep getting connection errors other apps are connecting fine i like the app but it s useless in the nonworking state on my phone right now,2,2018-05-09 19:41:01,1,
i was able to set up my account just fine but i apparently made the mistake of resetting the tutorial to better understand the ui i kept getting the same welcome here s what you can do with the app tutorial eventually it started to hang so i got fed up and uninstalled the ui looks nice but that doesn t mean it s usable i had a hard time figuring out the differences between the different areas to set up things you want to improve on the terminology isn t understandable no clue as to what separates habits from dailies from tasks and unfortunately because i still couldn t understand what i was supposed to do and where it s not very usable for me the bug that left me in tutorial hanging hell was enough i had it installed got a grand total of 10 minutes and i don t have the patience to wait out however long it ll take the developer to fix it phone google pixel latest version of android as of 17 march,2,2018-03-17 06:09:43,3,
too casual cannot create routines for specific days only app assumes that every day is exactly the same stats are random and don t represent actual skills i prefer life rpg time time pomodoro app,2,2018-03-16 22:29:44,0,
i really really want to like this app i can get as far as setting up and tracking tasks which is awesome but as soon as i try to form a party and battle monsters it runs up against some issue with google authentication i think and i can t go any farther i even tried to delete my account and start over but when you get to the step were it says type delete in all caps there is no keyboard or place to type so yeah great concept but it has some fatal bugs,2,2018-03-15 20:50:42,10,
please hire some competent android developers throwing up can t connect to the server messages 6 times in a row when i switch networks is just pathetic,2,2018-03-15 14:35:22,0,
i seriously don t understand the basic functions of the app are so janky and broken in the avatar creation i had to keep pressing the options i wanted over and over for it to actually work then when i finished the avatar had options i didn t pick every habit defaults to being both positive and negative i know there has to be some default but it s kind of weird that if i have a positive habit i have to tap the negative button adding tags is really clunky because the tags have to be added to the filter i guess it works but it s unintuitive to have to add a tag to the filter instead of just tagging the task itself but when i add them they don t immediately get added they disappear and then get added a few minutes later half the time it won t let me move around the tasks sometimes the faq text pops up overlaying whatever screen i m on switching between habits dailies to dos and rewards is finicky sometimes swiping doesn t work sometimes trading the icon doesn t work i have to tap things in the equipment menu multiple times for them to work same for the avatar menu with patience all this stuff does eventually work but it s tedious to just use the app the app would be 10 times better just by fixing the buggy menus,2,2018-03-15 13:16:04,0,
glitches abound inputs ignored not given options to make habits at points,2,2018-03-13 12:22:19,0,
it honestly saddens me to write this review habitica used to be an amazing app i need it for all of my dailies and to dos but ever since the code was migrated the app has been nigh unusable at the moment i can t even login when i finally manage to my dailies and to dos don t show up it s a struggle to mark a daily as completed because it takes forever for the server to recognize that i tapped on the daily overall this app needs to be reworked i really hope things can be fixed because i want to keep using this app otherwise i ll have to find something else,2,2018-03-10 11:31:55,2,
fix the thing idk is that a bug of anything else i hardly click the next button or text and its look like nothing s loading makes me wait and think is it loading or not then i restart the app but it became worse my character not loaded and the button became harder to click,2,2018-03-02 21:30:04,4,
aeesome concept but very buggy and laggy won t register my taps in some places it skipped my tutorial because it wouldn t register my taps to continue,2,2018-02-27 20:35:45,0,
not a good start the ideas are sound and i ve gone in with hopes but i ran into issue after issue right at the start can t get glasses to select can t add my beard or moustache without gems can t even party with my wife because of redirect errors i like this idea a lot and my wife adores this if these get fixed i ll edit and bump up the rating,2,2018-02-27 18:44:00,6,
great idea riddled with bugs i can t use the app at all without an data connection which is annoying because there s no internet related interface that i ve seen so far i have notifications set up that work maybe twice a week i really want to use this app but the bugs make it hard,2,2018-02-16 09:55:52,1,
habitica is great on browser and indeed has helped me tons to manage my routines but the app itself doesn t function properly now i can t even scroll down the pages to pick dailies that are further down or habits sometimes a newly hatched pet won t appear and neither will food and it doesn t tell how much damage i m doing to a boss and the browser version has some bugs too sometimes logging in it will display in pt despite being set to english i assume it s my browser s settings but the page s options should prevail over and synching will sometimes take gold health or mana away randomly still kicks the app s ass in every way,2,2018-02-10 04:23:08,1,
the bugs are annoying and keep it from being a better app update still has way too many bugs that never get fixed downgrading from 3 to 2 stars,2,2018-02-07 17:42:09,2,
it s pretty good i really like the concept the app itself and the web app is super buggy so hard to invite friends to parties and the web app is really slow otherwise it s a great game edit app got even buggier sync is slow and pressing on habits doesn t work sometimes web app is better update the app is still horrible but i ve stuck to it because of the mechanics i ve been keeping up with my habits but i really wish they d fixed the mobile app,2,2018-02-06 10:03:04,3,
couldn t get buttons to function in the beginning couldn t you even start or set up anything besides the avatar,2,2018-01-26 10:00:48,0,
amazing idea however the programming is just not good its very slow and buggy and just makes the whole thing completely unenjoyable its ashame to see that performance issues have not been fixed over so mamy years of this being out if these issues get fixed id easily give it a 5,2,2018-01-24 08:58:02,1,
the idea is great but the design is cumbersome and counter intuitive i bought gems but was unable to set up challenges due to a bug in the app,2,2018-01-22 14:03:12,0,
went for this because of the graficzne theme found it boring uninstalled,2,2018-01-14 21:38:07,0,
wish sync was fixed it takes a lot of manual refreshing to do basic tasks such as refresh for the day or reload when you ve died ui could be better too i wish there was slightly more focus on the social side of it also slow unresponsive and unreliable really good idea but not great execution going to move on to a different app now after all this time,2,2018-01-14 19:55:35,1,
difficult to use,2,2018-01-09 00:36:40,0,
yeah too many bugs,2,2018-01-05 14:41:46,0,
the idea is great i ve tried so many habit tracker apps and this one is one of the best but i hate that it doesn t work offline,2,2018-01-03 08:11:48,2,
this app has a lot of bugs that need to be worked out the ios version is a lot better,2,2017-12-29 01:21:38,0,
way overcomplicated dailies don t turn red if you miss them i don t know how often you are supposed to perform habits sync is bad there is no local application state model and network glitches are disastrous however graphics are cute,2,2017-12-28 13:54:15,0,
i keep tapping and it s just unresponsive it seems like a fun app but to keep tapping and not getting anywhere is annoying it just stops please fix seems like a fun app to try out,2,2017-12-19 21:11:16,2,
i love habitica and have used it for years but this app has a pretty bad ui and is full of bugs disappointing,2,2017-12-15 14:03:24,3,
doesn t work on moto x pure far too slow to handle it i think seemed like a good idea but i can t access the features to make it workable,2,2017-12-14 20:36:14,2,
i used to swear by habitica for a long time but frankly i find it almost unusable the biggest most important problem is the way sync works you can t use habitica if offline or have bad internet connection you can t click several buttons in quick succession and you are never sure if clicking a button actually sends data to server android widgets are absolutely unusable habitica s manual frames it as if it s not their but user s fault i have more than a dozen of habits and about the same amount of dailies most of which are themselves checklists i keep track of multiple habits therefore i open habitica and press and many times a day sometimes several times in an hour if every time i try to register a habit or a daily i must worry about habitica not syncing properly then it robs me of time and mental energy which makes it useless for actually instilling habits,2,2017-12-09 00:11:33,27,
the ux is horribly clunky and it takes more than two clicks just to do anything coming from todoist to this is like a bird flying into tar pit all the habit and time management improving features are sort of stuck behind the horrible ui why do i need to see soooo many boxes and options when i just want to and a single to do further more why does it take 2 taps just to get to that screen in the first place if i m on the todo tab i probably want to add a to do i honestly haven t seen an app this bad in years,2,2017-11-29 02:53:02,0,
this app works awfully its a great idea but it needs tons of improvements connection improvements offline actions like completing a daily which can be checked later etc i need the paying buttons to work i can t buy 4 gems seriously do you want to get ever paid do something with this thing again it s a great idea but that s the only reason why i keep using it besides that its a complete mess,2,2017-11-27 22:07:34,0,
i really want to love this but it s just so buggy i d happily pay money for a working version of this app but not in its current state,2,2017-11-27 19:53:31,0,
cool idea lousy execution for one the app is horribly unresponsive i also encountered bugs all over and a crash within 5 or 10 minutes of using and figuring out the app,2,2017-11-27 08:33:19,1,
great concept but i just cant do quests,2,2017-11-14 13:07:12,0,
the app is soooooooo laggy always pop up and say no internet connection and fail to sync loved and used the web for a awhile but the app meh,2,2017-11-09 16:51:39,1,
this app is not working without internet connection it s unacceptable for the task manager,2,2017-11-08 21:58:26,0,
this is a good idea but not so well executed the app itself is buggy text lags buttons are unresponsive and resetting the tutorial makes it repeat every single time you open one of the tabs first impression were so poor that i don t want to use this app to help my tasks and habits,2,2017-10-29 04:25:39,15,
where do i add a new habit not a daily not a to do,2,2017-10-23 00:36:29,0,
the app used to be great until the update some time ago now it consistently crashes on my phone and very very rarely loads correctly if at all on my pc,2,2017-10-21 10:44:05,2,
there are too much connection errors and bugs and they are really annoying please fix it,2,2017-10-07 13:12:45,0,
i was excited to use this app and love the categories and reward system for habits dailies to do after a few days and several rookie mistakes that aren t explained well in the tutorial i realized this app is way too heavy on the game mechanics for my use i want to have a list of dailies to partially complete everyday to encourage reading and writing every now and then not everyday this app punishes you for not checking these things off everyday i totally didn t realize my character was losing tons of health until it hit the red zone i then started reading up on the death mechanic and am very turned off i can understand wanting to give the players consequences for missing a task but it shouldn t be health loss and it should account for how the player uses the dailies must complete everyday or bonus if completed they also do not make it easy to provide feedback all the discussion links either required creating a separate account different from the habatica account or were closed threads this app could be so fun but i feel it loses sight of promoting good habits organization i love gaming but this is super heavy handed mechanics to me would keep using this app if i could keep the lists alone,2,2017-10-05 14:33:15,0,
it s absolutely fine but can be a bit laggy temperamental,2,2017-09-21 11:05:59,1,
i m so disappointed here i ve read other reviews talk about the site being much better but here is the reality of that a majority of internet users don t use full browsers to surf it so this app had to be good because your habits are a private and important thing and it s absolutely not good the last but not only straw was when parts of a menu are rendering in completely the wrong place and won t clear inviting people to your party was way too confusing until i found out it didn t even work until i did it manually on the site there s more but i won t bother i know its supposed to be open source but is any testing happening i was trying to be an advocate for this and you guys just killed it for me with this bad app,2,2017-09-20 17:23:18,1,
really buggy right now there s no way to create a party on the app and i can t even join one the website can t seem to log me in and if i click on any of the links on the faq page it takes me back to the homepage also tasks are listed in the order which i put them and not in the order that they expire so i have to check each task for the date and time of expiry not only that the dates are displayed weirdly some have dd mm yy format while others have mm dd yy developers have much work to do,2,2017-09-15 23:22:04,1,
i wouldn t have given such a low rate if it wasn t for my honest disappointment and i promise to change to 5 starts the moment i m reassured that things got better this concept is amazing and the idea is just brilliant however this is by far the buggiest app i ve ever had on my android and the ui is just not well thought of guys please work on the bugs so i won t have to click 1 000 times before i get feedback that something happened won t have to reopen the app and lose all the initial welcome tour with all the choices won t have to use my full name without being able to change it because i signed up with google these things seem basic to me i really hope it will get better this app could be a life changer,2,2017-09-10 15:04:42,1,
i ended up giving up on this app a few years back i used it frequently and now recently i came back but it s just incredibly frustrating how it always returns server or internet errors and doesn t save my changes it s a real pity because it was a very fun app to use,2,2017-09-04 18:07:01,0,
i love the layout structure and simplicity of this app but it has one critical failure there is no way to view stats except how many times you have done a thing make the bed 23 times in what timeframe a month a year what is the percentage of days it has been made not made the only thing i feel like i have to show for this is virtual items if you would add satisfaction with good stats i would rate 5 5 kindest regards william,3,2020-10-24 21:35:25,15,
i hate to give this app 3 stars because i love habitica but while the website is fine the app has some problems 1 i couldn t find a way to turn off push notifications from new messages in your party s chat this would be very useful to users in large parties 2 i couldn t find a way to sort backgrounds by what i own i don t want to have to scroll all the way down looking for my old ones 3 i couldn t find a way to delete only some of the tasks from a broken challenge,3,2020-10-24 00:30:26,2,
i love the concept a lot but the actual gaming aspect of it leaves a lot to be desired if there was something we could do or level up to or actually fight maybe pokemon sort of format for the game that would really make it better and keep someone interested,3,2020-10-12 21:51:16,0,"Hi Iris, thanks for your review!

the app seems great and i had a really positive impression to it though i wish that it s functionality also works fully and properly when you are not connected to the internet that one was the bummer as to why i rated it low sorry its just i m more of an offline person and i want the apps that i install like yours are available offline given its features and functionalities i hope that you consider my concern,3,2020-10-04 22:02:29,27,"Hi EJ, thank you for your review!

this app is amazing it has a very user friendly interface i d say its great for developing habits making short daily task list but the only downside is there is no calendar view so i can t plan ahead and time things for the long run thats why i m giving it 3 stars,3,2020-09-17 19:06:57,2,"Hi Sam, thanks for your review!

the idea is wonderful truly but problems exist 1 bugs to do list and dailies keep being empty refreshing doesn t work only close and reopen app 2 monthly subscription seems highly excessive i don t like paying for a service that remains static this could and should imo be an offline app particularly with the existing obvious bugs payment is out of the question right now 3 tutorial is lacking i had to figure a few things out by myself as a first time user,3,2020-09-15 12:50:55,44,"Hi David, thanks for your review and feedback!

app is cool on the surface but has some things that could be improved on for example some things just aren t finished or stop working in a couple customization menus there isn t an option to take off accessories while that option is available in others menus suddenly stop working and you have to close and reload the app to fix it there is no in depth tutorial and a lot of stuff is up to you to figure out which can be confusing because the user interface isn t always clear,3,2020-05-28 01:19:36,17,Hi A!

it is a pretty good concept it s just not for me,3,2020-04-29 06:46:09,0,Thanks for trying us out. I hope you find what you need!
this app seems great i ve seen other apps gamifying your life but what i feels really works is that you can make a party of friends and get productive together while clearing dungeons and getting loot if you make a group of friends be aware that even if its just your friends in the group a single swearword will get you banned not a warning or anything straight up banned i got banned because i called my close friend a f word c word mind you not in public but in our little group where that sort of banther is normal between us mind you i d never talk to anyone like that in a public group i don t mind policing the language of users if they are abusive or using foul language like that in public but to me its a bit much to ban people for a private conversation where there was no victims but its not within my power to change the community guidelines hopefully i ll get unbanned so i can give the app a swing it does seem great only 3 stars for being so quick to jump the ban hammer will definetly change stars for the better if the community guidelines loosen up in regards to private conversations and partys maybe add a report button instead,3,2020-04-28 22:56:00,7,"Hi Sebastian.

this app seems to make me want to procrastinate more,3,2020-04-14 11:19:36,1,
this app has a fantastic concept that being an mmo style game based around your success in real life the game is entirely server based and i have a good internet connection but the app would constantly disconnect i would like a single player mode of some sort no need for like a story or something just something to see your effects in game so because of the insane amount of server issues i have experienced just using the app for a little but i could not recommend this which is a shame,3,2020-04-14 09:34:18,2,"Hi, thanks for this review.

i ve been using habitica for a few years now and while i love the idea from a technical standpoint the mobile app is broken it feels like something you would have on your phone back when touchscreens were a new thing the most annoying bugs are party screen not updating after you accept a quest invitation so you re not sure if you accepted it spamming buffs sometimes reduces your mana without actually applying the buff and party chat not updating have to restart the app to see new messages,3,2020-03-23 15:30:50,4,"Hi, thank you so much for this thoughtful review.

it s fun a great concept but the app itself needs work it locks up constantly and has to be manually shut down and then re started and the reminders basically don t work at all honestly i think it would be best to remove the reminder feature for now until it can be fixed because not having a way to set one at all is better than using the feature and thinking you ll get a needed reminder when you won t because it doesn t actually work,3,2020-02-29 10:14:56,6,"Hi Jenni, sorry to hear about the trouble.

the big cons to this app dailies tab always shows all of my weekly duties instead of the daily ones i change this in the filter but once i reopen the app it switches back to showing everything what s the point of a filter when the app doesn t save it galaxy note 8 also why is there no dark mode my eyes are screaming at night,3,2019-05-29 08:06:15,0,
i have been using this app for a while really trying to get to grips with it but i ve come to conclude that it s not me if you feel like you need less complexity in your life them this probably isn t for you as this adds a new system that you have to get to grips with and plus the gamification aspect can be quite destracting and finnecky i think if this were to ever be useful for me it would need a separate environment for tasks habits and dailies,3,2019-05-25 05:31:49,1,"Hi Bryo, thanks for your thoughtful review! We're glad you gave Habitica a try."
edit reverted to old version or something and issues are back edit issue fixed and new update is great seems like you actually passed the issue along instead of making complaining subscriber have to repeat the complaint in email huge fan of habitica used it for years it was called habitrpg when i started only to do list app i have stuck to encourages you to build good habits in a fun way community built no ads worth subscribing to support the app,3,2019-05-24 17:26:27,7,"Hi Bea, thanks so much for your review!

fun way to track habits it would be great if you could update tasks without an interent connection and then just sync the next time your connected like many other trackers,3,2019-05-22 03:46:05,4,
this app is very helpful total game changer for my adhd unfortunately after level 25 the app becomes a money grab and the items you find and the equipment you can buy with coins get severely capped but overall i m happy this app exists it really helps me stay on track perhaps if the game cost a few dollars to purchase the developers wouldn t need to resort to capping in order to create revenue from the app i feel as though many people will quit once the rpg element is restricted,3,2019-05-20 19:30:58,1,"Hi Stephiroth, we strive to keep Habitica from being pay-to-play, so items that must be purchased with real money are purely cosmetic and do not affect player stats.

having to find players to be able to do anything is a bit annoying it s really boring otherwise reminders don t work properly i set a bunch for last night that never happened and a bunch this morning that never happened it s not really built for proper daily routines including things you need to do twice per day so it s not really useful for me,3,2019-05-12 10:54:47,52,"Hi GN R!

incredibly useful service and thanks so much for creating it the app tends to be buggy but nothing that couldn t easily be worked around until the last update since the last update drag and drop sorting of to do and i suspect dailies as well subtasks checklists no longer works which is really frustrating at least the website works great as always it s just frustrating to have to run down to the computer to fix my lists,3,2019-05-09 18:39:38,4,"Hi Dave, sorry to hear about that issue!

the graphics are adorable and the ui is clean there were a few things that were a little confusing to find but there s a wiki that answers a lot of questions as well as the faq the only reason it doesn t work for me is because tasks feel more like currency than progression other task rpg apps either chart your progress or show it as a literal path which feels more like moving forward cute app but more for those who like armor building in mmos,4,2020-10-23 16:40:37,0,
it works but it has issues the thing is compared to some other apps of it s kind its not great it could use some more customization like custom items and the tutorial is kinda annoying especially with pre made tasks but it does what it says and well enough edit thanks to the habitica team for responding some developers don t care but it s good to know this app has a great community,4,2020-10-22 05:38:15,15,"Hi Ramen, thank you so much for this thoughtful review.

just installed yesterday and have used it for a whole day the app is very helpful is setting concrete habits to reinforce or discourage and comes in the familiar set up of a video game i d definitely recommend this to others who are trying to develop themselves one minor issue is that in some dark app themes the delete and save button can t be seen because the text and background have the same color other than that the app works fine,4,2020-10-08 14:17:43,13,"Hi Raphael, thanks for your review and glad you're enjoying the app!

it s a cool app but i wished there was a way to know how much you have improved week by week or a similar record it doesn t really push you to improve just to do something if you do less than before it s ok you just advance slower and you keep going slow it would motivate me more to try and do better than the last day or the last week but i wouldn t know how that was unless i took a screenshot,4,2020-10-03 09:21:28,26,"Hi Monica, thanks for your review!

this is a fun way to build the keystone habit you need to make all your other daily habits click into place i think the mechanic of guilds is probably one of the most engaging things about it my critique is that in order to access the challenges available from the guilds you re in you have to get on your desktop this is super annoying because i d rather only use the mobile app fix this and it s an easy five stars,4,2020-07-07 23:23:26,41,"Hi Carly, thanks for your review!

this app has become my life i truly love it it helps me work towards my goals in a very fun supportive environment my down points would be mainly because of gems while the game is free there are certain things you can only get through buying gems which is understandable they need to be able to support themselves the game my problem is that while you can earn them for free it s damn near impossible to compete with 200 people in one challenge and get rewarded,4,2020-06-23 15:03:33,43,

great app for those who need extra motivation this is just my idea but why don t add timed to do in image of monsters or something that will reduce the health of the protagonist or any negative effects if they did not finish it on time it may as well push the user to work immediately later than procrastinate i think i got more ideas but will be too long to write here so anyway nice app cool app,4,2020-05-21 09:55:01,0,"Hi Rex, thanks for your review!

good base needs greater rewards and harsher punishments include more visual audio cues for success and failure take notes from other games that make a big show out to clicking a button which heightens the stimulation the player recieves,4,2020-05-19 08:54:10,2,"Hi Dylan, thank you so much for this thoughtful review.

the app is what you make of it a big imagination will take you far i wish it had better mobile support though many functions require a computer and it d be nice to be able to preview all the cosmetic options that cost gems the cash currency without a preview its almost gambling especially with hairstyles,4,2020-05-09 10:23:07,21,"Hello, we're happy to hear Habitica has been helpful for you!

i love this app and all my friends use it and compete against each other this is a brilliant concept however the app seems a bit buggy i was in beta programme and then i was unable to send invites or buy certain items i thought it s because of beta being unstable so i opted out of beta and reinstalled the app still didn t fix the issue i m the party leader and the group isnset so that only i can start quests still anyone starts a quest without me knowing and i don t face this on browser,4,2020-05-04 10:43:28,15,"Hi Navinya, you can send bug reports directly to the developers with Menu-About-Report a Bug, and that will send the team some information about your device to help them find the problem.

pretty good app however there s a point where i m not making much progress unless i have gems i understand why the gems are there but as someone who isn t willing to spend money on an app it makes it a little boring overall great experience and helped with my habit building,4,2020-04-29 10:06:24,2,"Hi Charity, we're glad Habitica is working for you!

i was introduced to this app by a friend and it definitely didn t disappoint the task manager is very fun to use and is extremely customizable and the events and group activities make it even more fun though the menu navigation could be improved as well as the rewards for doing tasks because i don t feel too motivated to do the tasks still,4,2020-04-26 15:28:32,12,"Hi Vinny, thanks for your review!

so far i like it however there are so many items on the lists when you first download it that it gave me anxiety you can only delete them 1 at a time and it wants confirmation before deleting each one if the developers see this i suggest only a few items on each list to give as an example instead of the 200 i found on my lists that all repeated although the check here for downloading the app gave a lot of xp,4,2020-04-20 08:43:27,29,"Hello Alison, thank you for your review and sorry to hear about the trouble!

love this app and use it daily great for task managing and motivation if you like games and collecting things there are a couple of bugs though and the app does not support some of the features available in the web version which i find a bit odd the phone is the best place to keep a to do list as it s always with you so i dont understand why the app isn t a priority im also missing an option to search or filter my inventory other than that i really like it,4,2020-04-17 18:35:05,2,"Hi, sorry to hear you've had bugs.

habitica is the best productivity app i ve used thus far it lasted me for months the quests are the most motivating feature and i was able to take down a couple bosses solo however motivation dried up weeks into my first fetch quest because despite being extremely productive i had no chance of finding even one shard unless you re comfortable teaming up with a bunch of strangers to take on quests there becomes a point when being solo makes the quest motivation feature impossible,4,2020-04-01 00:40:39,6,"Thanks so much for your review, we're happy to hear Habitica was helpful for you!

i love this game it has helped me do much it s a bit of a learning curve it would be nice if challenges were visible from the app in all of the guilds and i would also like to see the last day and time that a habit was marked because the colors don t always change and if you have a lot of habits it gets confusing otherwise this app is brilliantly done and will be getting my monetary support in whatever way i can afford,4,2020-03-04 02:50:52,6,"Hi Sarah, thank you so much for this thoughtful review and your kind words!

i ve tried quite a few rpg like to do list apps and i must say this one is the only one that i find genuinely enjoyable and actually kinda feels like a game you can tell a lot of effort was put into the aesthetic everything is very easy to access and is pleasing to the eye although i think there should be a way to uncheck to do s i keep accidentally clicking on them in the widget and remaking them every time is starting to get annoying,4,2020-02-17 20:17:22,10,"Hi Elo, thank you so much for this thoughtful review.

great idea and i m enjoying it so far chores and errands are much more fun my one gripe so far is that it seems like most items quests cost gems which are pay to play i m afraid i ll pretty quickly run out of free items quests to strive for and then the app will lose its effectiveness it d be helpful if their were other ways to unlock gems outside of paying for them like reaching extra high levels of productivity habit building etc,4,2020-01-05 00:21:22,24,"Hi Garrett, thanks for your review!

not very expressive frame for activity descriptions must be in the first stages of development guilds look incredible diverse very surprising it is a social app seems the leveling function is standard gaming and well embedded hope open sourcing it make it better fit passing habits to to do would be desirable,4,2019-12-11 11:08:57,0,"Hi Synoptic 1, thanks for your review!

i m easily motivated by things like points and streaks so this app works really well for me to increase my productivity and decrease my anxiety i use rewards for breaks and find that i get unpleasant but short tasks done much more often because i can earn breaks quickly by just getting them over with i also get my long complicated multi part projects done early i gave it four stars because there are a couple of features i d like to see but it works great as is,4,2019-12-10 18:47:36,7,"Hi Jinjer, thank you so much for this thoughtful review.

i m surprised this app actually works for me it helped me procrastinate less but i also realised it works only if i remind myself to check the app a lot i recommend it for those who have really bad procrastination problems like myself even if the game style of this app isn t your thing it s a great to do list app for habits daily reminders and general to do items only complaint is it s glitchy for me when i want to customise my avatar,4,2019-12-05 16:07:12,3,"Hi NotChelsie, thanks for your review!

i really like the concept of this app the style the features and it has done its part in motivating my studies and organizing my life however the app needs some serious redesigning the layout is difficult to navigate and the chat function is almost useless the way challenges are organized could also use improvement all in all i like using it make an account a month ago but the functionality needs to be improved,4,2019-12-04 10:40:37,2,"Hi Dany, thanks for your review!

this is a very helpful and fun way to get yourself in the habit of doing things the daily tasks are a fantastic way to get your daily stuff handled and check them off within the app you ve got the ability to create to do lists with due dates and notification reminders can make it ridiculously simple to get even the most complex task completed on top of all this seeing your character earn experience new items and getting pets and mounts turns all the monotony into a wickedly awesome rpg,4,2019-11-22 16:29:27,4,"Hi Manic Surry, thanks for your review!

have been looking for a way to incorporate the elements of gaming into making progress in real life even tried inventing something for myself but paper tracking was a nightmare and having it in this app is just fantastic really like it and it has made a big difference the only reason i took it down a star is because it depletes my phone battery really fast if i am in the app for very long such as when i am shopping or browsing challenges so i do these things mostly on my pc overall great job would recommend this to anyone that enjoys gaming but is struggling with motivation in the real world,4,2019-10-23 20:22:31,14,"Hi Brenda, hank you so much for this thoughtful review.

i have been using habitica for quite some time now and i must say it has been the most useful in helping me establish a structure to my day however the to dos are very limited in its functions it s hard to implement a full task management such as gtd methodology it pretty much only supports next action steps not any layers such as projects or waiting for also syncing across devices can sometimes be problematic i hope they will improve the to dos and make syncing smoother,4,2019-10-14 04:55:23,1,"Hi Abdul, thank you so much for this thoughtful review.

i like it a lot but it doesn t have as much of the game aspect to it i wish there was a feature where you character could actually play in an rpg game using the equipment and skills you earned you could have a little rpg game on the side and has cute little morality stories without it it doesn t really incentivize much,4,2019-10-01 01:09:16,2,"Hi Mady, thank you for taking the time to leave this review!

i used this all the time before and it was fun in the beginning but got really tired of the low res graphics if they were a bit more high def it would be amazing we could finally see the equipment customization better more motivating to continue using and complete tasks,4,2019-08-07 00:35:59,1,"Hi Jordan, thanks for your review.

i guess i love it as it kind of works i mean this is as good as an app can get for it s purpose it has the perfect amount of features and completely customizable the biggest problem i have is at the beginning it s very challenging to keep alive as you have no party armour yet and also as far as i m aware i could only edit the order of the dailies i wish they can be done to other sectors too,4,2019-07-24 05:10:23,11,"Hi Emily, thanks for your review!

love the idea but the execution is kind of clumsy there s little to no guidance with regard to how parties or challenges work and the rewards seem to be random at best the graphics are adorable and the app definitely has potential though but it would be more user friendly to streamline the app because it can be overwhelming with so many choices and options i e mounts food eggs etc that seem mostly arbitrary,4,2019-06-06 07:57:21,0,"Hi Jae, Thank you so much for this thoughtful review.

one of the most flexible productivity apps i have used works as a habit tracker daily reminder list and a to do list which is great if you want to have an overview of all these things inside a single app makes your tasks feel less overwhelming by keeping the theme light and fun the devs add new content to it constantly and the community is able to create guilds and challenges offering a more social experience than most other productivity apps,5,2020-10-05 15:36:32,13,"Hi Margarida!

it s a nice to do list app for me separating things into habits dailies and to do s isn t something i really thought about so it s helped me plan what i want a bit better i just wish there was a late night mode where it acts as if it s yesterday so you can accurately reminesce about what you did that day i usually plan things out at night also turning a to do into a nice grocery list would be nice too trying to put it in the notes of a to do doesn t really work since you can t check,5,2020-10-05 14:28:24,19,"Hi Michael, thanks so much for your review and your kind words!

i am completely in love with this app this app has changed my life completely which is why i want it to get even better here is a small recommendation make a 4 week calender system a b c d week so that if you want to make a schedule where you take 1 day off after 3 days of work it is completely possible to make a routine that will keep repeating itself 4dayx7 4x7day by simple math once you get to 5th week you are back to the same pattern as that of 1st week and so the cycle goes on,5,2020-09-03 19:03:02,0,

i really really love this app the gamifying is really good and i especially love the guilds with various creative monthly challenges another pro is that most people don t spend too much time chatting the chatting is limited to a healthy amount cuz ppl r busy with tasks and it is still social enough to provide enough encouragement sharing of thoughts and pointless banter to take ur mind off stressful stuff,5,2020-08-23 19:53:54,11,
this app has helped me in doing my tasks on time it helps me to be more accountable and be more responsible enough the gamified style kept me going as i see how much my character levels up,5,2020-08-23 12:21:17,1,

great i would recommend the following features skills when you work on a task you could select which skills you will be working on a timer keep track of how long you spent working on a task and consequently on the skills this would allow a summary of how long the player spent on each skill maybe skill trees being able to create publix skill trees for a project hobby etc would be a very nice feature too,5,2020-07-26 22:20:53,0,

love the app so far great for motivation but non punishing cute graphics and lots of stuff to explore splitting up tasks by priority type is awesome it really has made everyday life feel more guided and fun would highly recommend for people who enjoy collecting gaming or seeing your progress add up one note is that sometimes lists of tasks disappear show tasks already completed closing and reopening fixes it but would appreciate it if this bug was addressed,5,2020-07-26 09:18:25,9,
best productivity app,5,2020-07-26 07:29:46,0,
the game aspect is fun and can provide a little added motivation but beyond that it s one of the best free to do apps i ve found the organization is easy and the breakdown of habits daily or other schedule tasks on repeat and a one time to do list give much more depth than apps that claim to be more professional if you like the game ify idea this app is great if you want a solid free task manager ignore the cute icons and go with this one as well,5,2020-07-24 19:23:48,26,
very creative and a good idea too,5,2020-07-23 19:20:18,0,

amazing app one request from the developers this app is turning humans into better humans so the rouge class should be renamed to the ninja or something as it affects the subconscious brain of users without even them noticing it this pure psychology and this is how low of attraction works never talk or think of things which you don t want in life you yourself would not want anyone to be rouge so please give rouge some positive polish if you can only a humble suggestion,5,2020-07-06 15:46:39,6,
i have used this tool continuously since 2015 and it s a fun way to get yourself to do tasks that otherwise you might not be motivated to do i ve been a subscriber for almost two years i would highly recommend habitica whether you prefer to do it all on your own quest with others take up challenges or just keep track of your flossing there s a lot to out and i ve never gotten bored in almost five years,5,2020-07-02 08:20:07,25,

my rating to this app just dropped from 5 to 1 mainly because of this company s marketing strategy on how to pressure someone or the previous users to buy their pro version there were many beautiful trees in store where you can purchase for free with free version now it s only possible by having the pro version it s quite disappointing that this app doesn t allow you to feel motivated and pull you down by offering their worst trees masterpiece i won t give my 5 till this issue fixed,1,2020-10-15 15:06:56,16,"Hello, Thank you for your feedback.

the new update locked several of the trees behind a paywall this is disgraceful because all users should be able to unlock them by using the app there is no justification for taking away important parts of the app that were previously available to everyone and now only premium users can access them the devs must change this back so that all previously released trees can be unlocked by anyone edit there are many other reviews with the same problem but the devs don t care listen to the users,1,2020-10-03 23:28:04,26,

used to be great until they became too pushy to upgrade to the paid version now you need to be on the pro version to buy designer trees as compared to the early days where you could just purchase them even on the free version quite disappointed with the development team frankly,1,2020-09-27 07:35:57,17,"Hello, we have made changes to the relevant mechanism in order to prevent pirated software.

this app has definitely helped me put my phone down but you peak fairly quickly in the unpaid version and run out of rewards after using it for six months i ve run out of trees and plants to purchase so there s not much more to add to the experience in terms of utilizing my coins when i get a new phone i wasn t able to transfer my account and discovered that the unpaid version has even fewer options available than before,2,2020-10-16 20:08:29,48,"Hello, we have made changes to the relevant mechanism in order to prevent pirated software.

i used to love this app it felt really rewarding to have focused long enough to buy a cool new plant you ve been saving up for now those trees are locked behind a premium wall they re charging you for content they offered for free before it seems like they re taking advantage of their users and charging money for an app catered towards helping broke college students study seems wrong especially during such hard economic and social times i m a long time user offering 2 stars,2,2020-10-15 20:19:17,16,"Hello, we have made changes to the relevant mechanism in order to prevent pirated software.

time to find another app the pro version is really good and i understand it is needed to provide good services but there are plenty of other versions rather than making only 10 trees available for free version users put more adds add in app purchase to purchase like coins or an upgraded coins like every game app do make special tree more expensive in coins this update really kills the appeal of this app,2,2020-10-15 13:56:19,32,"Hello, we have made changes to the relevant mechanism in order to prevent pirated software.

Thank you for your feedback. We will forward your suggestion to our team."
incredibly disappointed with the new update this app used to be visually pleasing because of the vast variety of trees but now you have to pay for every good aspect of this app while i understand the developers need and deserve money there is a limit,2,2020-09-13 15:27:42,8,"Hello, we have made changes to the relevant mechanism in order to prevent pirated software.

basically if you don t have the pro version you can t use 90 of the app such a good app but you have to pay for each and every new options for studying like pie chart trackers no good,2,2020-09-13 07:13:23,2,"Hello, we have made changes to the relevant mechanism in order to prevent pirated software.

this app is really very good but i m disappointed with the new update majority of the tress have been added to the pro version i happily updated to see if any new species is added i recommended it to many of my friends but i m seriously very disappointed,2,2020-09-12 23:05:39,2,"Hello, we have made changes to the relevant mechanism in order to prevent pirated software.

i realy like this app rhe thing is that you only can buy some specific trees and for the others you need the pro version and befor you just can buy more trees,2,2020-09-12 21:52:08,0,"Hello, we have made changes to the relevant mechanism in order to prevent pirated software.

this app has become more and more money driven as someone who has been using this for years and across multiple devices this is really disappointing more and more features that used to be free are being locked behind a paywall hopefully someone comes out with a similar app because the concept is good but now everyth needs to be paid for,2,2020-09-12 10:58:12,19,"Hello, we have made changes to the relevant mechanism in order to prevent pirated software.

sad that the feature of being able to pick which apps can be blocked are for the pro version only as well as many of the other tree species i ve saved up some coins to be able to buy one of the more expensive ones but now i won t be able to unless i buy pro which is a shame what species left for the free version is also very few now not as fun to use this app now but i guess i understand the need for money,2,2020-09-11 13:57:05,12,"Hello, we have made changes to the relevant mechanism in order to prevent pirated software.

i loved this app and there was so much to look forward to until i got limited to 7 trees and everything that actually getting me excited to work harder just got locked i can understand the reason for making the pro version better but i dont see why u had to make the free version borderline useless to do that,2,2020-09-11 11:36:36,10,"Hello, we have made changes to the relevant mechanism in order to prevent pirated software.

they just had to lock away half of the unlockable trees it was hard earning coins day by day hoping one day to unlock all trees frequently i d watch ads to double the coins i ll earn but now since they locked them up for good i guess this coins of mine are only good for deleting my record for dying trees,2,2020-09-10 23:47:05,10,"Hello, we have made changes to the relevant mechanism in order to prevent pirated software.

who would want to continue using the app for free with such limited trees i guess this app isn t student friendly such a shame it was really a big help to me it s sad to finally uninstall after a long time of use,2,2020-09-09 18:11:20,3,"Hello, we have made changes to the relevant mechanism in order to prevent pirated software.

the ads don t always give you double coins bc there are some you can t close and they just loop when they re done so the only thing you can do is close the app and then you don t get double coins edit bug is mostly fixed the way to opt out of the second ad now appears after 5 seconds unfortunately the update locked most of the unlockable tree species behind a paywall so the app just got a whole lot less interesting for me,2,2020-09-09 12:08:44,19,"Hi, sorry for the inconvenience, please update the app to the latest version.

what motivated me to keep using the app was collecting coins to unlock different trees now to unlock must of them is not enough to collect coins now you have to have the pro version i was earning to get the sunflowers why why i ll have to found another app also i don t think it s ok to only plant trees in real life only having the pro version use ecosia browser instead not sponsored and stop monopolizing our planet s health,2,2020-09-08 12:33:28,11,"Hello, we have made changes to the relevant mechanism in order to prevent pirated software.

i used to love working with this aoo and it was helpful but the recent update is frustrating it sounds vast inequality among your paid and unpaid users and it seems foolish to paid only for some species while you can get other effective apps for free mu aim is to upgrade my focus not to buy trees so really upset for this unfriendly update and yes uninstalling it,2,2020-09-07 08:42:34,25,"Hello, we have made changes to the relevant mechanism in order to prevent pirated software.

it s a good app to block your phone if you want to focus for some time the thing is it is not as good if what you want is to stop over using your phone altogether also the last change of moving certain tree species most of them almost all to premium is kind of lame since so many functions are already only available for premium accounts couple that with how much time it takes to get a tree and this change seems unnecessary since use time also means more adds watched and more revenue,2,2020-09-06 22:55:39,1,"Hello, we have made changes to the relevant mechanism in order to prevent pirated software.

great app and concept but please in the next update please add an option to pause the timer also make it an option in settings not in deep focus mode because there are some thoughts that need to be addressed for a few minutes and if not addressed can ruin all the session it can also help in plant together because i have seen many people that gets an urgency but don t want to give up which breaks the loyality and ultimately breaks the purpose of planting together,2,2020-08-10 21:09:51,0,"Hi, thank you for the advice.

i used to love this app until the most recent update you have to unlock the pro version to buy most of the trees which is very disappointing i used to motivate myself by collecting money and buying an amazing tree but now you can only buy small plants with the free version,3,2020-10-19 19:09:31,1,"Hello, we have made changes to the relevant mechanism in order to prevent pirated software.

disappointed when you change all beautiful plants to be available only after upgarding to pro version it will only discourage people to download your app or even lose existing users suddenly it s pointless for non pro users to save coins the purpose of helping us focus would also be hindered,3,2020-10-19 15:05:07,2,"Hello, we have made changes to the relevant mechanism in order to prevent pirated software.

The purchase of Forest made in either iOS or Android is not transferable as Apple and Google sell the apps in their own market. As app developers, we are not in charge of the app-selling process.
You'd need to buy the iOS and Android versions separately, but you'll be able to use the same account on multiple devices on that platform.

hey forest team seen your progress grow over the years loving the new favorites and tags interface what would make it better is allowing multitag selections this is one pomodoro app that doesnt have breaks pls add a break timer after each sess would be nice under your new ui no trees would be selected or planted of course customized break times can also be added to favs thanks lots of love,3,2020-09-23 12:03:40,1,"Hello,

i like the overall idea behind the app but i think that it s becoming more of a distraction than helping me stay focused 1 i d prefer to set pomodoro sessions with breaks between them rather than having to do that manually everytime 2 also i don t understand why there is not an alarm after each study session and i have to check when the time is over 3 i don t like the way focus mode is designed i d prefer to not receive notifications from the apps rather being unable to use them,3,2020-09-21 18:53:05,98,"Hi, sorry for the inconvenience, if you are using the free version, please email android.support@forestapp.cc.

i m giving this app 3 stars right off the bat because of ad walls but heres why i understand that app developers need to make money somehow but there are multiple ways to do it and this is not the right choice for an app about productivity productivity is about managing your time when your developer makes you sit and watch an ad its a waste it is immediately sending the message that they do not care about your time and therefore they dont care about your productivity just your money,3,2020-09-10 21:42:19,87,"Hi, sorry for the inconvenience.

great app i wish plants and sounds were cheaper basically you get coins for planting trees and you can use them to buy other types of trees and different background sounds,4,2020-10-21 17:52:22,0,
i really love this app it helps me focus i recommend it,4,2020-10-21 15:33:10,0,

this app is so good but premium is very is not very good as before it was released lots of the now premium trees where not originally paid for so i think that there should be no premium,4,2020-10-20 21:40:17,0,

i love this app and use it religiously while studying it is a life saver i use the app along side the desktop chrome extension and i tend to start both timers at the same time this messes with my stats and the length of time i have stayed focus is doubled i wish there was a way you could chose to limit multiple devices at one time now i don t know how feasible it is but it would be really helpful and really add to the experience of using the app,4,2020-10-20 05:39:57,55,

i love the app it really helps me focus on my work and organize the recorded hours for study work rest etc i only wish that they put a break time when we study because if i pause it either kills my plant or i have to restart planting again i always study 2 hours but i like to take breaks each hour also the plants you get are very limited i had this app for 2 years and they used to not charge you not coins to plant cool plants but now they do other than that it s a great app,4,2020-10-15 20:10:27,2,
has really helped me stayed motivated and focused on the task at hand i can set specific tasks to what i m doing and timers to go along with them then to make it fun i can change the type of thing i m growing really good for youth all the way to professionals,4,2020-10-15 19:59:18,0,

i write this after the first use and yes i will be using this for studying cleaning and what ever else i need to focus on i love the art and simplicity of this app the unlock of different trees makes this into a little game as a side bonus if i try to roam into different apps on my phone it will tell me to get back to business they took away the unlock trees paying for the nice looking trees is something i won t do not happening but the app still works well and does as stated above,4,2020-10-15 17:19:34,133,

4 5 it deserves a 5 since it really helps with staying focus for a period of time yet i would suggest to somehow overlay a social place in order to focus together with friends and that if you paid for the app which i did gladly get more currency ingame kinda sucks to pay for premium and still need to grind for new trees at least open a few more for premium users so they would be more motivated to unlock more trees,4,2020-10-15 16:22:09,2,

absolutely love the app the graphics are marvelous however the only tweak that should be made in my opinion is for the timer to be atleast 3 hours longer i understand people could take advantage of that because some could do it while sleeping but with the pandemic 5 hours would be nice maybe 7 for people doing school the phone for me has been extremely distracting for me this app helps me heavily but when the timer is only 2 hours max i inevitably take advantage of this distraction,4,2020-10-07 10:50:15,29,

i had pro version already so i didn t lose access with the update but its a crappy move to lock everything behind a paywall they still make money off most of us because the ads after every tree for doubling coins i make a lot of small trees too because its easy small goals make for l u s h forests the time crystal currency that lets users get missed event trees for a couple dollars is a good idea though they can make their money and people who had a hiatus or started late arent left out,4,2020-10-03 22:47:04,4,

update october 2019 very dissapointing the syn function is no longer working which i found out while rying to transfer my history to a new phone some other reviews have noted that too the export option also seems iffy at least when i tried to e mail the export nothing happend and i found no import since i paid for the app i would expect these to be available will change stars if resolved it s dissapointing because this is one of the best habit tracking app but the lack of sync and export inport function is a deal breaker update march 2015 what happened to the option to switch between the weekly and monthly view it was very useful i tried a number of other apps for habit tracking and this one is the best so far very clean and easy to navigate interface useful statistics and clear feedback on both the streak and the overall trend and percentage i love the easy way to switch between weekly and monthly view one suggestion would be to include a colored bar for each habit where the colors are based on the daily success and failures i saw this in one of the better iphone habit apps i actually used habit streak pro for years and i did see habitbul earlier but the bull icon deterred me from trying it because i thought it looked really cheesy the app behind this cheesy icon is actually the best of the habit trackers i have tried so far keep up the good job,1,2019-10-26 02:18:33,1,"Hi Jan, thanks for the review. Due to a request by Google we had to redesign the interface and now you can switch between the weekly and monthly views by selecting ""All Habits"" and an individual habit in the sliding menu on the left."

widgets don t work unless you open the app and sometimes you then you even have to take an action or two within the app wish this product was maintained have emailed the developer but they didn t get back to me the app doesn t even support logging out anymore the usual uninstall reinstall didn t work,2,2020-10-21 07:36:14,7,
i really like the app but i wish that i could slowly increase my goals without losing my streak,2,2020-10-18 02:42:18,2,
the user interface is not user friendly no one likes to use a complicated app to build habits which will make their work even more harder make it simple and easy to understand man,2,2020-10-16 00:23:29,0,
it is difficult to understand,2,2020-10-15 12:37:47,0,

like many premium users i received an automated email letting me know that following a bug my password was reset after that impossible to use the premium features any more developer doesn t respond such a shame,2,2020-09-26 05:12:03,28,
i really like the app i ve even purchased the ad free version to support the developer however be advised if you use the app and need to change your phone or reset it your data will be lost and you will not have any support after i factory reset my phone i don t have any of my previous habit data even though it s supposedly synced with my google account that s over 2 years of info that i lost i ve sent multiple emails to the developer and have not received any response since,2,2020-09-25 15:39:31,65,
it seems like a good app but only offers 5 habits to track on the free version i ll stick with it for now and see if it is helpful over the 66 recommended days but might uninstall if i feel the need to monitor further habits,2,2020-09-18 01:34:34,1,

this app has not been functioning this week it has not been reminding me on any of my habits super frustrating i loved this tracker and now i may have to look into another i ve tried deleting reseting uninstalled and reinstalled nothing but if you remember on your own you can put it in and it ll keep track,2,2020-08-07 05:50:27,35,
reminders ain t working,2,2020-08-06 17:11:37,1,
a little too complicated and dictatorial too many prompts plus only 5 habits allowed unless u buy the pro version 7 10 habits and i may hv left it on my device and give it a proper run instead i decided to uninstall and download a simpler version which is more flexible and suitable to my needs,2,2020-08-05 16:08:29,3,
free account limited to 5 habits,2,2020-08-03 09:34:05,0,
reminders only pop up when i remember to open the app which defeats the whole purpose if the reminders popped up automatically at the set times i d give the app 5 stars,2,2020-08-03 04:14:58,3,
complexity and unavailability of useful feature for free kill the interest atleast widget should be available for trials,2,2020-08-01 22:04:18,0,
advertises that you own your data and you can export your progress in reality they don t let you access that feature without a premium membership i don t mind paying for features and services but keeping your data behind a paywall is dirty i d recommend finding a foss habit tracker,2,2020-07-15 21:29:27,3,
very simple ui potentially too simple and plain but hard to tell without using it for extended period of time some may like it scaled back look can only add 5 habits before having to pay a fee for premium hardly enough to actually truly test drive the app before paying seems costly for the simplicity of the app,2,2020-06-16 03:53:40,4,
only the premium version is good for use free version is a waste of time,2,2020-06-12 10:18:15,1,
only 3 stars because after the first 5 options no more then u have to pay,2,2020-06-05 11:14:20,1,

man this app is great simple but complete which makes it very effective customization options for habits are excellent and connecting to specific communities a huge plus highly recommended if you want to keep track of your progress towards a goal updated logging features are still as good as ever but since syncing is impossible i can t see the forum anymore as my user doesn t properly log in and there is no customer service i can t recommend it anymore,2,2020-04-16 22:09:56,53,

edit initially gave it 4 5 stars the app itself still works fine but the sync stopped working about a year ago that s the main reason i paid for the premium version i messaged the developer about it and never heard back wonder if it s been abandoned by the developer,2,2020-03-27 05:09:01,2,
seems like it could be very helpful getting very frustrated with it always opening on monthly view even though i have weekly view selected in settings even tried switching it but no matter what opens on monthly,2,2020-03-20 08:33:30,0,
i liked it when i first got it several years ago but after installing it on several devices i found it does not sync with the other instances of it after getting no response from their support desk i uninstalled the three apps from the three devices and reinstalled them using my google account in case i had not logged in with the same account on all the three new instantiations do not sync the help desk is non existent the idea is good but the app is defective,2,2020-03-19 05:58:00,0,
very simple app to track your progress towards acquiring a habit the only downside is that you can t sync the app as it says no internet connection when there absolutely is also together with this bug all forums are no longer available as well as daily quotes it s just gone previous rating was 5 stars but with this bug continuing for half a year now i can only give 2 stars,2,2020-03-13 10:50:57,25,

i ve been using this app for more than 5 years it was great but currently i changed my phone and found out that syncing doesn t work anymore it says something like no internet connection so at the end i have to use another app,2,2020-01-26 13:47:16,0,
i really like this app enough to purchase the premium a few years back but the app didn t update to premium for me and there was no response when i contacted the support seems like i m not alone in this experience don t put your trust in the developers,2,2020-01-26 03:50:01,3,
mixed great app but don t by premium won t work without play services and developer unresponsive,2,2020-01-10 18:35:48,0,
edit update purchased premium sync doesn t work a quick glance at developers fb twitter accounts shows that they have basically dropped off the face of the earth no activity since 2018 app hasn t received an update since 2018 my suggestion pick an app that s still actively developed exactly what i have been looking for fantastic interface and thoughtful design i m hooked guys,2,2020-01-07 05:47:51,0,
worked fine for months now it doesn t track habits the way i set them it treats every day as its own success or failure regardless of how i have set it up going to have to uninstall and find a new habit tracking app,2,2020-01-05 05:32:58,0,
the motivational messages are annoying you can only track up to 5 habits in the free version but it is totally not worth paying for more good riddance i suppo this kind of app is just not for me,2,2020-01-03 14:15:28,0,
the tracker itself is not bad but i set up a notification to remind me to do something and am not getting them i already checked my settings all is good it s nice if you remember to go in and mark done but notifications are not working,2,2020-01-03 04:02:08,1,
can t choose when to start i like setting goals habits for advance dates once i m done with one also you can t edit a habit goal to start over you have to delete and start new doesn t save your previous habits goals to do again,2,2020-01-02 20:14:28,1,
i liked the app until it told me i could only have 5 goals,2,2020-01-02 00:03:42,0,
the only part of this app that doesn t impress me is the widgets everything else is beautiful good visual layouts simple quick tracking but enough features to be flexible for different needs update 12 30 2019 the app no longer syncs and does not import data i ve got a handy cvs export with 3 000 lines of habit data thank goodness but can no longer reccomend the app if it requires manual input to restore data,2,2019-12-31 04:33:33,0,
i had to buy this app because i need that larger widget to fit my needs and you cannot test it out with the free version sadly it s too buggy to be of any use at least on the aio launcher still overall better than my last habits tracker but i feel ripped off,2,2019-12-29 19:32:33,3,
customer support is completely unresponsive i purchased the upgraded version and it doesn t sync as promised there has been no help on fb email nada kinda sucks tbh the app is nice the android widget is what makes it great plz fix the sync issue and i ll update my review if your customer support reaolves the matter and makes things right with me,2,2019-12-29 01:41:39,20,
only 5 items on free version would be nice to have that clear so i don t have to waste my time and give out my email,2,2019-12-23 20:55:39,0,
love and use the app but sync feature does not work and my attempts at eliciting support from customer service have gone unanswered which is disappointing,2,2019-12-22 22:31:42,1,
worked well for a few days and then just stopped sending reminders the reminders would pop up if i opened the app myself but that s obviously not the point of a reminder also froze a lot pretty much useless when it worked it was excellent,2,2019-12-19 01:20:02,6,
can t sync i paid to have the ability to make more tasks but that s about all it s good for,2,2019-12-13 02:42:58,0,
i really think the math is off on this logically it does not make sense that if you have a good day your percentage of success goes up by 1 but if you have a bad day it goes down 20 that really defeats the point of motivation and self forgiveness,2,2019-12-06 17:01:46,0,

do not buy premium version app stopped synching 7 27 2019 and is no longer supported i got premium to sync to new phone since i ve been using the app for over a year and wanted to keep tracking 10 wasted very disappointing because basic version is great simple but fully functional and effective for tracking up to 5 habits good visuals and the ability to make notes premium tracking 5 habits and syncing across devices but no more would be 4 stars if still supported and worked,2,2019-11-10 13:11:38,19,

while i can understand limiting somethings for premium only i ve never seen an app block widgets behind a pay wall and quite frankly this is only useful to me if i can keep track of things on the homescreen maybe i would have liked it but so far i havent used it because i keep forgetting its there,2,2019-11-05 14:12:24,1,

great app in the beginning but once you start skipping days the notifications become insulting shaming words for example calling me a couch potato which i am not so dumb what expert would ever say that insults are motivational almost none i d rather use an app based on the principle of kindness not shaming,2,2019-10-10 22:43:09,1,
the app is good to use overall except as a number of other folks have said it does not sync and there is no response from the developer on this issue annoying to have paid for an app that claimed the sync feature when it doesn t actually work what that means is you lose all history every time you change the phone,2,2019-09-30 05:50:44,18,
really 8 for a habit tracker there are other apps that do the same thing for far less money i don t mind paying for apps but this seems like price gouging oh and it s 10 if you want the ability to export your data,2,2019-09-30 01:39:28,1,
it seems like this app is no longer supported i ve paid for premium but sync stopped working several months ago and developers have not replied to a support request so on moving to a new phone my habits and streaks are now lost i can see from other reviews that this is a widely reported issue i guess the app has now been abandoned,2,2019-09-24 19:22:52,278,
the app is constantly loading and you can t even record your habits and reminders don t work also having just 5 habits free is bad too,2,2019-09-23 00:08:00,0,

i like how the app has options to write notes journals for each day it gives you the option to reflect on how you stuck to your habits most other apps don t have this feature that said i m rating the app two stars because the notifications don t work for me i have set times for reminders throughout the day but the app sends me random notifications reminders when i don t want them and on other days no notifications at all no app updates from the developer in over a year either,2,2019-09-17 08:38:01,4,
does not sync,2,2019-09-15 22:27:28,1,

i liked the app and i purchased it but i can t sync any data from old phone and when logged out of the app there is no way to login again except reinstall the app so if anyone is fine with restart all the progress everytime you change phone this app is for you but since i like to keep my progress to the new phone i am stop using this app and find another one,2,2019-09-14 01:04:50,15,
no notification of habit tracks,2,2019-09-13 13:57:22,1,
good app but don t bother with premium i bought premium for the powerful widgets and ability to track extra habits don t bother the widgets are nothing special and if you read the tips section the developer even says it s best to only track a few habits at a time after feeling ripped off i emailed the developer twice requesting a refund but have received no reply great free app but don t waste your money on premium,2,2019-09-10 18:14:12,12,

i upgraded to pro after a couple of weeks initially excited about the app having used it for a while now i m starting to regret my purchase there are some pros but more cons it s buggy doesn t sync well at all across devices the ui is very cluttered the forum needs serious updating a search tool for eg the last update was ages ago given how pricey this is you d think the developers would make it worth it but they seem to have disappeared,2,2019-06-22 22:41:05,177,

this would be great if it didn t require me to mark negatives in other words it requires me to mark everyday i did not do something such as smoke a cigarette or drink alcohol this is overly cumbersome over time and is going to cause me to stop using the app because i don t want to have to check everything that didn t happen this could be much better if it assumes i didn t drink or smoke if i didn t make any mark for that day or at least give me the option to do it this way,2,2019-05-20 02:00:07,5,

awesome tracker yet it seems overpriced in my country way more more than the typical range of 5 its about 10 for me with tax included also i don t appreciate the greyed out price being the same as the 33 claimed discounted price very deceiving lastly the lack of support for a fingerprint access method is subpart for 2019,2,2019-04-16 07:07:07,1,

i love that you can chose x amount of days a week to complete a habit other apps force you to commit to specific days the flexibility in this app helps me succeed what i hate about this app is it fails to get my habit completion for example i did my workout for the day but still receive repeated notices to do said workout for that day way to drain any joy out of an accomplishment habitbull,2,2019-03-29 04:10:55,9,

reminders are not working i have an asus zenfone 4 shouldn t matter and i have set the reminders multiple times with no success i feel this is the most important part of this app as i need reminding in order to affectively create a habit any feedback would be greatly appreciated my rating my change after feedback,2,2019-02-01 20:51:50,0,
it s misleading to list data export as a reason to buy premium when it is not included with premium it would be great if you could change this to accurately describe your three tier pricing system additionally the platinum purchase option is currently showing me the full price even though it is advertising a 33 off the greyed out full price is exactly the same as the 33 off price will give higher star review when these are fixed,2,2019-01-30 14:57:46,93,

i would not recommend this app bc of an essential flaw in design it doesn t allow you to just type in habit instead it quizzes you so a simple act of just typing what you d like to do turns into this crazy and overly complicated thing,2,2018-12-07 21:16:02,8,

i loved the app and purchased it to help my son keep up with studying i paid for the premium account which indicates you can log in on multiple devices both ios and android after setting it up on my phone which was easy but took some time when i tried logging onto my son s phone it didn t recognize the account i contacted customer service but didn t hear back it s a nice app really like the features so this was really disappointing i could set it up again on his phone but without me being able to monitor on my phone it s not helpful i still hope someone can help me fix this or i should get a refund for my purchase,2,2018-11-18 19:48:32,12,

sorry for the poor rating but your app has a major bug swiping up or down while viewing details for a month habit makes the interface jump to details for another habit randomly it s a pain to realise midway that suddenly you are reading incorrect data happens so many times that it s not funny will be looking for alternatives to your app,2,2018-06-09 22:44:45,1,
great design except they hide the fact you can track 5 on the free version until you go through the process of adding all five individually then you find out you can t add anymore without premiuthem freemium is fine hiding the cut off wall is not,2,2018-06-01 03:32:39,1,

i paid for premium some time ago just got a new phone and installed the app and was unpleasantly surprised to find that my email address was not found in our database this apparently means that all my synced data habits and history are completely gone i created a new profile with the same email address but the app still does not appear to be syncing at all i ll continue to use the app for now as i still like it best out of all habit trackers but be warned there is no backup sync support here,2,2018-03-22 07:11:06,4,

almost perfect however the widget bugs out and freezes as soon as you try to make the daily bigger than the far to small preset sizing also needs to allow for a one off to do list similar to how habitica has a dailies habits and then one off list,3,2020-09-21 04:28:35,2,
nice app but need to fix some bugs first app crashes when i click on go premium also even if i am connected to wifi some big image is not loading on home screen wondering what s that image,3,2020-09-20 21:32:10,1,
it s good for what i needed simple good stats like the for color coding don t really need the chats on topics i don t look at or use that i wanted more than 5 items on my list and the widget for easy tracking on my home screen the widget only works sporadically to check off an item that s annoying considering i paid the one time fee apparently it s known issue should ve readmore reviews and maybe not purchased,3,2020-09-20 08:36:31,16,
it is great for keeping track of my habits but i never get any reminders i ve checked my phone and all the permissions are there but still no reminders i just get a tiny message that tells me the app is running but disappears without doing anything i ll persevere a bit longer but if it doesn t remind me there isn t much point as i will forget to do things,3,2020-09-20 02:44:04,30,
too costly for premium,3,2020-09-19 21:02:55,0,

over priced under developed app the free version only allows for tracking five habits and the premium version is about 5 a month the app lacks the polish off others available for less and feels more like a beta than a final product in the end i found a better app that s completely free has more features and a cleaner ui my advice to the developer is to ditch the subscription model or make it less expensive and annual,3,2020-09-14 16:21:16,117,

not great but good enough to track habit and keep record read atomic habits to understand and learn the how and use this app to keep track should yield a better result reminder not working,3,2020-08-27 18:06:16,1,
it s about what i d expect from a habit tracker i chose this over another one for the motivational quotes only they just just up as the error picture icon without the actual picture if i can t get the picture can i at least get alternative text for the picture that has the quote moto z2 force,3,2020-08-26 21:42:38,13,
i wish there are better graphs to see the dips and raises in my performance the current one is way too compressed and looks just like a straight line inspite of the dips,3,2020-08-24 07:04:27,4,

no resent updates cloud based csv export is avaliable in only pro no option to manually mark skip fail but we can select targets like less than or greater than too can t select date range in graph report local data import export is missing habits can be archived but category group is missing multi device sync is avaliable a very good alternative to habithub,3,2020-08-20 07:28:02,19,

great app just can t justify spending 8 10 in order to track more than 5 habits when there are other apps out there i don t need to pay for to do so i m switching to loop habit tracker can track as many habits as i want and back everything up all while being entirely free plus it s really nice,3,2020-03-24 00:15:14,20,
the concept has had an extremely positive effect on my life however i am experiencing bugs with the widgets where exercises are disappearing restarting hasn t helped,3,2020-03-23 05:16:59,0,
could be a great app except that like another user said it does not sync between devices when the description claims that it can that s a big letdown for me because when used any other of my devices and when i switched phones i couldn t sync the app up with my data or any habits i ve been tracking even though i have the premium account when attempting to sync it always says that there is no internet connection but there always is so i can t give it a full 5 5 rating otherwise i might,3,2020-03-20 12:22:47,14,
i think it could be more user friendly but maybe i haven t explored it enough it keeps asking for a rating maybe it will stop now,3,2020-03-12 16:29:28,0,
i actually really love this app i used it to create some serious personal progress i purchased the full app but when i bought a new phone it wouldn t let me sign out of my old device and into my new device i emailed support about it crickets never heard from them if they can put together a decent support team i would give the app a 5 for sure,3,2020-03-09 11:00:56,6,
there s this weird bug now where the screen dims and keeps showing the loading sign but you can still use the buttons please fix it,3,2020-02-27 11:49:17,0,

i am not satisfied with this app because circles used for completing the habits look very dirty,3,2020-02-11 08:03:16,0,
can only track 5 habits but there are discussion forums most of the forums have no activity going on but there are still a few users to talk to often times the app no longer syncs me to them just like right now the quotes have been stuck too developers no longer support this app do not buy the premium version as you will not be able to sync across devices there are no more updates or customer support this could have been the absolute best habit tracking app so much wasted potential,3,2020-02-08 12:29:05,29,
this deserves 5 stars but i am not able to see discussions since the last one week,3,2020-02-07 14:33:57,1,
probably a good app and way to track your new habits but not being able to make a widget without a premium account is ridiculous,3,2020-02-04 06:01:23,0,
great app lots of ads,3,2020-01-31 12:35:34,0,
navigation needs work you can only navigate with the many buttons in the app the back button closes the app feature request has weekly and monthly report would like a daily report to share with an accountability partner also would be great to generate report based on category,3,2020-01-30 05:18:08,0,
great app so long as you only use the free version which only tracks 5 x habits used the free version for a couple of weeks then paid 9 49 for the platinum version so i could sync to other devices really disappointed that the sync option won t work and software support is non existent for an expensive app i would expect the developers to be as helpful as possible when a customer has an issue but they have completely ignored my request for help,3,2020-01-27 01:29:05,8,
i really like this app and find it useful for keeping me on track simple but effective i used the free version for almost 2 years at the end of the first year it reset and i lost all of my history so before the end of the second year i bought the premium version and promptly lost all of my history again i contacted support to see if they could help and got no response at all i still recommend it for tracking your habits but don t expect to keep the info long term or get help if you need it,3,2020-01-20 18:00:49,6,
really enjoying this app but wish i could track more than 5 habits,3,2020-01-20 09:30:27,0,
too invasive and complicated,3,2020-01-18 11:54:47,0,
this is a good app but the data analysis and visualization is fundamentally broken the score and success percentage function in that they record the success values for the end of each day and then add that to the database this means unfortunately that your success percentage never goes above your first day when if you did the thing you got 100 as such the visualizations are useless a better solution would be to include rolling means of success percentage by x number of day intervals,3,2020-01-04 23:41:54,4,

it s a great app and has definitely helped me maintain my habits i had been gifted premium early on but i ve found that the features have disappeared and i m only seeing the base version i like it enough that i want to buy it but i worry about whether it will keep the features based on my experience and other reviews i ve also found a bug when i have a goal set to 3x a week as success the app doesn t recognize when i ve had a successful streak and always shows as 0 successes in the streak section whereas it s at 80 in the percent success section and many weeks of meeting my goal,3,2019-12-17 01:14:18,0,
it s good app but it s not free if you want to add more than 5 habit,3,2019-12-14 23:38:17,0,

i think the app is very good has helped me to keep track of my habits however i wish there was a function whereby you could postpone a habit for something out of your control i e not going to the gym because you re on holiday this although a break from the habit doesn t feel like it should affect the moments when you are focused and in control of keeping the habit also how is the success percentage measured if you only have to do the habit a certain number of times a week,3,2019-11-02 06:02:59,2,
does exactly one thing tracks habits but does it well and without pointless bloaty extras or ads clean interface sadly app seems to have been abandoned by developers and premium features like sync no longer work no way to transfer data,3,2019-11-01 13:29:24,1,
i liked how i could customize everything but my linked google fit didnt update my steps i had to input myself and my notifications would only go off if i opened the app myself kind of defeats the purpose of linking and setting up notifications,3,2019-10-31 00:28:10,0,

just changed phone didn t keep anything from my premium account can t even create a new account without erasing current data 2 for that inconvenience has helped me tremendously develop new habits ui is perfect the app and widgets allow quick and easy habit tracking counting habits are useful but it would be great to be able to see near misses in order to track improvement better customization of the interval chosen to calculate percentages would be very helpful,3,2019-10-11 08:33:29,14,
pretty average app,3,2019-10-08 00:15:42,0,
the reminder option is not working i have paid for premium to use the app to its full potential but unfortunately the basic feature of the app to remind you to stick to your schedule with respect to habits you creat dosent work kindly help by resolving this issue color code options are limited that can be assigmed to the newly added habit,3,2019-10-05 06:19:33,0,

the app does not let me create a widget despite the fact that i have logged in,3,2019-09-16 20:16:16,0,
lots of unnecessary notifications the gui is confusing and is missing a few features for a habit tracking app like splurging only every x days but no less,3,2019-09-16 08:12:49,1,
the free app is too limited other than that it s a good one,3,2019-09-15 23:56:16,0,
doesn t save habit data when you switch to a new phone even using the same login information won t let me choose a start date for my habit either so it never shows 100 success like it should,3,2019-08-25 01:43:12,8,
the setup seemed nice but the constant pop ups are so annoying as to make it unusable,3,2019-08-22 22:51:53,0,
so far it s not flexible enough for me also there needs to be an option to remove general discussion from the dash board there seems to be a startling number of people with goals surrounding masturbation and porn and i just don t need to see that when i m trying to inspire myself to play more music i m going with the stars as a benefit of the doubt as i haven t given it much time but i can t see me using this,3,2019-08-16 02:55:20,9,

i like this app and what it can do and am pleased with its functionality however having paid for the premium version i find it annoying beyond belief that i get pop ups every 2 weeks asking me to leave a review so developers i ve left one but you ve lost 1 5 stars for spamming me with these requests this shouldn t happen in a paid app without any opportunity to turn off these notifications,3,2019-08-06 12:23:52,14,
synching between my chromebook and phone is a necessity for me and does not work on this app the color coding for completed tasks is not intuitive,3,2019-08-04 20:09:14,1,

good app but faulty notifications the notifications and reminders were working perfectly but they only work now if i open the app by that point it s too late i need the reminders to work to be effective i purchased the full version,3,2019-07-24 02:11:11,0,
dont buy the premium the widgets don t work the reason i bought premium and i set up notifications for each hour to remind me of a task but the notifications only pop up if you open the app which render the notifications useless otherwise i enjoy the basic use of the app,3,2019-07-19 22:40:46,3,
it s ok but a bit too simple and the inspirational messages don t change not really very motivating to use this app compared to my previous habit tracker the app s look doesn t come exciting to look at as well,3,2019-07-19 19:04:16,0,
i paid for the premium version but all my habits records was deleted without explanation they fix that problem,3,2019-07-06 14:55:30,1,

it s a great app and works great helps me keep track of whether or not i took pills or did excercises or not however it lacks the feature of multiple times a day so if for instance a person was trying to create a habit to do something twice in one day this app won t help since you can only click that you did it once does anybody know if thier is an app that has this feature,3,2019-06-21 03:01:07,2,
i bought the paid verison it does help us track the habits with simple yes or no questions and by answering with numbers but habits aren t as simple as it is we need other methods to track habits like options to enter time if i want to develop a habit of waking up by 7 it shouldn t be a yes or no question i should be able to enter the time track it over the month,3,2019-06-20 19:20:59,2,

great format and tracking 7 seems excessive for upgrade feature to use as a widget also people have a form of spirituality rather than a religion can that not be reflected in the app too for inclusivity removing forum comments would be a great option an unnecessary distraction,3,2019-06-09 22:07:04,0,

great app easy to use custom colours and categories for each habit limited to 5 habits on the free version is the only gripe,4,2020-07-05 03:35:22,0,
i love this app i like how simple it is to use worth purchasing the only thing i wish is that it would open to the weekly spot instead of to a single habit maybe there is way to make that happen let me know but if you are looking for simple but great habit tracker i highly recommend this one,4,2020-07-04 20:16:20,8,
the best habit tracker app i ve seen would ve done 5 stars but i feel like something s missing and i can t quite put my finger on it,4,2020-07-04 06:20:47,0,
its great and easy to use but still the developers should try to make it some sort of strict,4,2020-07-03 15:03:17,0,

this has been a great app to build habits i would give it a 5 star but your limited to only 5 habits at a time you can get more but theres a pay wall,4,2020-06-06 06:11:50,1,
looks like it s not supported anymore shame i used it for about a year and really liked it edit looks like it works again no idea when it stopped being broken as no dev ever responded to my inquiries about the malfunctions four stars because i liked it while i used it but i have found something better loop instead of once per week you can set a goal of once per of days works better for me and is more useful,4,2020-06-04 10:49:54,59,
really good way of tracking habits and progress exercise and quality of baby s sleep are my uses only 4 because there could be a little more on the customisation front even if only in the premium version perhaps i d like to see something like a target for average number instead of pass fail that d provide an extra way of approaching habits i think i m picking at hairs though it s a very good app that does the job it advertises,4,2020-06-03 13:22:33,15,

great for tracking your bad habits making new good ones and building a better lifestyle for yourself bought the full version for more habit tracking which is great if you are dedicated but 7 99 is a pretty hefty price for just 100 habits some inspirational quotes and a mediocre social system it has helped me better myself over the past week of using it so i d highly recommend trying it at least in the limited free version before buying the full version,4,2020-05-30 10:42:42,54,
good better than the other apps,4,2020-05-27 12:57:34,0,
good habit tracking app,4,2020-05-26 05:48:21,0,
tracks many tasks in great detail statistics available on averages and streaks etc it has progressive tasks so you can check on goals that are multiple times daily like drinking water and come up with more info than pass fail my only qualm is the color the display is very busy and colorful i would also like a quicker interface for progressive tasks,4,2020-05-25 16:35:54,14,
why there is different icon showing of app in play store and different on my phone pls make it same,4,2020-05-25 10:42:49,0,
wonderful app i m just wondering if i overlooked something because if for instance i set a habit to every 3 days but end up doing it every 2 days instead the app is counting the 3rd day as a fail which seems very strange to me since i actually did better than needed,4,2020-05-24 10:58:23,15,
this has been a pretty indispensable tool for me it motivates me to do the tasks that sometimes i would really rather not do like put in eye drops or exercise my personality requires checklists or i ll find excuses to skip doing things,4,2020-05-23 18:58:27,1,
it s a little too early to tell so far pretty good,4,2020-05-21 04:52:24,0,
really remarkable app,4,2020-05-20 19:55:47,0,
used it on off for years motivational but not annoying like some nice design various views week month specific habit progress wide variety of goal options such as doing something x amount of times a week or every x day of the week or month all the stats you can set a date to achieve the goal app recommends like 60 i think discussion boards other features as well i just don t use them much all in all great app,4,2020-05-20 08:18:42,66,

i love this app for easily tracking my habits to work towards personal goals there s only two things that could make this app better being able to disable decimals on specific habits to count full numbers would be great as you do sets of a workout and make updating the count easier and not losing the progress of a goal if you change the specifications to meet it like going from doing 10 to 20 pushups a day and not losing the streak from before the change was made,4,2020-05-06 09:21:28,32,
bug has been fixed now i can use it with all my devices,4,2020-05-03 12:45:52,0,
using the free version and it s easy intuitive and highly flexible it reflects just what i want to track for five different tasks each week from simple task tracking of daily meditation to more complex tasks like 3x a week business actions where i log time spent on these actions and notes too i ve already recommended it,4,2020-05-02 21:34:30,6,
i have only been using this app for about six days however i m really enjoying it i like that you can mess with the color scheme and the encouraging quotes it s also affordable if you are more than five habits one thing i think that would be absolutely amazing to have on here is a spot for goals and some kind of daily journal write aside from that i love it so if it had a spot for journal writings and goals it would definitely be five,4,2020-04-30 09:12:56,8,

this is the best app i have ever used to keep track of my activities the greatest part is that each time you feel like giving up to achieving your objectives it will always remind you which is very motivating i only have one problem though having trouble with syncronising my progress which means if the app was to be accidentally uninstalled and then reinstalled again then all the progress i had saved would be lost so this one reason i give you a 4 star rating instead of a 5 good app though,4,2020-04-06 15:31:44,13,

in general this app helps me keep track of my habits which is great however the app has quite a few bugs even after buying the premium version which is disappointing the sync function doesn t work at all and i don t see any effort to fix these issues this is one of the rare apps where i won t be giving a 5 star review,4,2020-03-24 18:02:34,13,

i like the app have been using it for a few months now and the widgets plus reminders definitely keep me on track only drawback i ve found is the inability to sync my profile always fails with sync failed make sure you have a working internet connection have sent in support request but so far no response that aside the app works well and i can still use it in standalone mode on my primary android phone,4,2020-03-10 00:18:36,10,
it is all for me about habits i wasn t able to work on it but in this one it is so helpful just i have one issue i don t know if didn t find it or it is not at the program that if u need to remind your self more than one time in the day i just remind my self once a day i don t know if it in the app or not,4,2020-03-08 19:52:08,0,

liked the setup so much that i quickly became a premium user the widget alone is worth it i love the flexibility the app allows in specifying when i can work on developing a habit as i am frequently adding habits i would like to rearrange habits in the list to make it easier to find them hopefully this is an easy fix then this will be a 5 star app,4,2020-02-18 23:03:24,10,
a good starter app 4 collecting the data you need to better your daily life limited flexibility in the free version but sufficient four basic tracking of self improvement efforts easy to get started and so i can do without cute reminder and encouragement features they are easy enough to toggle off,4,2020-02-16 20:58:37,0,

i like this app i have used it for a while now and it helps only reason for 4 stars is that the percentages are frustrating i managed 122 days straight but it won t change from 98 i think once you do the full 66 days you should get 100 also would love to be able to highlight a day in the future as a milestone just different colour so i can say 50 100 days etc as a motivator it s great for a free app we ll done to the devs on this,4,2020-02-03 02:42:49,10,
love this app but it only lets you keep track of only 5 habits at once for more you have to buy premium but other than that its great,4,2020-01-29 07:06:30,0,

i love how simple this is it s helped me focus on those important things that i want to accomplish i just wish there was space for more than 5 free habits this means if you decide to track something else in that space then you ll lose the data unless of course you write it down before changing it this is why it loses a star in my opinion it s the best free habit tracker i ve found a lot of other apps have free trials which i don t even bother with,5,2020-10-22 07:42:05,125,

latest update makes the widget not working,1,2020-10-20 18:29:39,0,"Hi, can you please try reinstalling the app. Please contact us at support@do-it-now.app if the issue persists."
pay,1,2020-10-12 15:04:25,0,"Hello, can you share more details about your problem at support@do-it-now.app?"
the app sends too many notifications with annoying sound,1,2020-09-16 06:43:02,0,Thanks for the feedback. You can easily disable general notifications in app settings and task notifications on each task edit screen.
spam notifications when the to do list app auto updates it changes you settings for example causing spammy push notifications to pop up after i previously disabled notifications,1,2020-09-05 04:36:30,1,Thanks for the feedback. Could you please specify what kind of notification you received?
it shut down after i tried to delete the preset characteristics and i lost everything right after i had just set everything up really frustrating,1,2020-08-30 03:41:03,0,"Wow, that's unfortunate. I'll take a look and try to fix the issue."
between tasks randomly failing without any input and undoing failed tasks creating fake duplicate tasks that cannot be deleted this app is too buggy to use for its intended purpose,1,2020-08-14 09:04:29,1,Thanks for the feedback. I can assume that you enabled auto-fail for some tasks and when they become overdue - they failed automatically. As of duplicated tasks - when you undo not last execution of task it is designed behavior to create single time task from that execution to not disrupt current execution of original task.
seems like if i don t want to follow that junk on instagram i get 15 points instant uninstall,1,2020-08-07 00:56:23,1,"Thank for the feedback. If you don't like that task you can just delete it, no punishment will be done to your hero, this task is just an example on how you can work with the tasks."
not very intuitive,1,2020-08-04 18:12:58,0,Can you please share which features you find difficult to use? Please contact us at support@do-it-now.app.
it takes forever to download,1,2020-07-22 19:16:07,0,That's unfortunate. But there's no way it can be related to the app since app download part is fully covered by Google Play. I'd appreciate if you update your review and rate app higher.
i haven t even opened this app and it s already drained 30 percent of my battery wow waste of time and space,1,2020-07-14 00:34:59,0,Thanks for your feedback. We’d like to know the details of the problem you mentioned. Please send the details to liferpgtasks@gmail.com. We'll see if there is any way we can improve it.
50 for a simple app no thanks,1,2020-07-04 17:10:49,0,"If you are unhappy with any of the features, you can contact us at liferpgtasks@gmail.com."
this is a really dumb app,1,2020-06-16 20:59:44,0,"Hi, could you please tell us why do you dislike our app? If you have any suggestions, please send them to liferpgtasks@gmail.com."
this app automatically downloaded when i did not ask for it very intrusive,1,2020-05-29 14:22:08,0,"Thanks for the feedback.
Unfortunately, I'm not able to help you with the problem, since app installation is Google Play feature and not the Do It Now. So I'd really appreciate if you rate app higher than 1 star."
novel but boring,1,2020-05-25 05:34:40,0,"I regret that you did not like the app, but thanks for the feedback."
is quite expensive,1,2020-05-23 23:50:48,0,"Thanks for the feedback.
I'm trying to add as much free features as possible, but app needs to be monetized in order to support and improve it, so some small part of features were moved to paid version."
do not use this app if you need reminder notifications as they do not work even with app visable on screen let alone in the background app is pointless as does not stay alive in memory ignore reviews from users who have not tested the app you cannot set a notification after task start time so no way to confirm task completion widget does not update dev not interested in fixing complaints still exist since app creation many better apps to use instead this app does not work,1,2020-05-22 02:44:01,0,"Thanks for the feedback.
That's unfortunate that you have negative experience with the app.
I can assure you that I'm doing me best to make task as much useful as possible."
tested on 4 android versions and devices 1 reminders only work with screen on app in foreground app doesn t stay in memory 2 can t rearrange hero screen to move graphs to bottom 3 every notification perform button click annoying popup to confirm again can t be disabled 4 needs option for notification x minutes after task start end users need notification to inform what to start plus notification option to confirm it s done at the task end time subscibe when fixed,1,2020-05-12 00:38:40,6,Thanks for your review and for useful suggestions!
doesn t work at all as a developer myself it s clear they don t know what they re doing it should have every possible one but doesn t have any broadcast receivers or persistant notification to keep it alive from android oom freeing up memory which explains no one receiving notifications as seen in other reviews even when active notifications only received upon screen on despite battery optimization execlusion or doze completely disabled with root 5 stars and will subscripe once fixed,1,2020-04-30 13:39:38,5,"Thanks for the feedback.
We're using FirebaseJobDispatcher to schedule notifications and planning to move on to WorkManager. I suppose it should help to solve this problem."
this app will create a review my tasks reminder when you launch it for the first time and by default will set the reminder to 5 hours before this can mean it will wake you up in the middle of the night with this reminder playing a loud notification sound it ignores the do not disturb mode of the phone it fails to show any visual notification so you will not know why your phone is making sounds in the middle of the night,1,2020-04-30 11:25:24,43,"Thanks for bringing that up.
I'll review this task and especially notifications sound in Do not disturb mode."
too complicated ui design i just need a mindless tracker,1,2020-04-28 16:50:04,0,"Thank you for the feedback.
I'll work on UI design and will try to improve it in future."
unusable and badly designed due to being full of confirmation pop ups and bugs everything you do or don t do in and out of the app is followed by dozens of pointless pop ups which causes the app to constantly crash e g there s no need to confirm notification button presses once there s an option to disable all pop ups this rating can be updated to 5 stars and all of us can subscribe to premium let s see if the developer is interested in fixing and receiving more subscription revenue,1,2020-04-27 22:15:21,6,"Thanks for the feedback.
I've already removed duplicated in-app popups for auto-fails and auto-skips which were shown in notifications.
I'll consider adding option in settings to remove popups for in-app actions like task execution or fail."
too complicated wanted to use to strategize for my exam but it was to difficult to add a task,1,2020-04-17 18:54:09,0,Can you please share which features you find difficult to use? Please contact us at liferpgtasks@gmail.com.
i like the app a lot bit i can not make the notifications sound to work i have enabled all notifications in setting both the phone and the app but the only notification i m getting is in the notification bar without the notification sound the app is quite useless,1,2020-04-12 06:06:09,0,"Thanks for the feedback.
Please check that app is whitelisted in Battery Saver in device settings.
On some devices Battery saver could block notifications from the app."
good app but does not respect do not disturb mode and keeps waking me up every night edit the issue is fixed giving the deserved 5 stars edit2 this is not fixed after all somehow this app not only not respects the do not disturb mode but also manages to send notifications one hour after i fell asleep today it sounded around 4 am,1,2020-03-23 08:42:43,10,"Thanks for the feedback. This issue was probably related with problem which was fixed in recent update - notifications were played back on multimedia channel. Now notifications work on ringtone audio channel which should be muted when do not disturb is on. Please checkout recent update :)
UPD: Thanks!"
i just cannot be notified please fix it so i could give 5 stars,1,2020-03-17 09:55:08,1,"I can assume that you checked app section in device settings and notifications are enabled.
Could you please also check that app is whitelisted in Battery saver, sometimes it blocks notifications from the apps."
i love all the recent changes you have made especially the ability to undo things in the history could you please add an option to manually reorder tasks i would like to put mine in the order that i do them throughout the day and none of your sorting allows that thanks update it s been 22 months since you said you d make drag and drop sorting an option i see monthly updates but not the one feature that would make this app user friendly don t promise what you won t deliver,1,2020-03-14 12:07:37,6,"Thanks for the review and suggestion.
I'll add it to development plans."
don t offer to send notifications if you won t actually do it that was the whole reason why i thought this would help me and it didn t will be uninstalling,1,2020-03-10 19:32:55,3,"Thanks for the feedback. Please check if notifications are allowed in app page in system settings and please also check that app is whitelisted in battery saver, it could block the notifications."
too much ads appeared out of no where,1,2020-03-03 04:37:36,0,"I'm sorry for this, but to continue work on this app I need revenue from ads. If you don't want to see the ads you can purchase the premium version. Thanks for your understanding!"
key functionalities of the app are hidden behind a subscription of 6 50 per month with the best deal simply shameless,1,2020-02-25 20:50:38,2,"Thanks for the review.
Month subscription costs $2.50 per month and if year subscription is purchased even $1.50 per month.
Also all major features except calendar and smart groups are fully available in free version."
ads too frequent didn t even finish setting up first days tasks,1,2020-02-21 17:03:12,3,"We are sorry for this, but to continue work on this free app we need revenue from ads. If you don't want to see the ads you can purchase the premium version. Thanks for your understanding!"
there are more effective and honest ways to turn a buck in the playstore crippling your app with a paywall only drives home just how unnecessary the app is,1,2020-02-05 07:43:23,1,"I regret that you did not like the app, but thanks for the feedback."
could be good if basic features like icons weren t locked behind a paid subscription update your calling themes an advanced feature because you want to not because it is one sorry but changing the background color to black which it should be in the first place isn t an advanced feature it s about one line of code i m a software engineer myself and know the difference between the two same goes for icons which are essentially to app functionality check out notion for a great example,1,2020-02-03 07:11:40,48,"Thanks for the review.
Most app features are open for all users in free version. Exceptions are some advanced features like calendar, smart groups and visual enhancements like icons and themes."
crippled version without even a way to purchase outright edit i ll be clearer many apps features are disabled but there is no way to just buy the app the only option is some ongoing payment subscription which makes no sense as this app does not provide any ongoing or backend service it s just an app and a simple one at that it s like going to buy a water bottle and going to check out they take your credit card info and charge you the same price every year that you use the bottle bottom line it s just a scummy business practice,1,2020-01-15 06:43:29,64,"Dear User,
Could you please contact us via liferpgtasks@gmail.com? We'd love to hear more about this issue in order to assist you."
only just discovered there s a bit of a sub didn t make that clear before sign up no chance its a cheek doing it sneekly you should be ashamed deleted,1,2020-01-13 00:08:22,1,We apologize for the inconvenience. Can you be more specific please so that we can identify the issue? Don't hesitate to reach out to us at liferpgtasks@gmail.com.
the app is amazing and has the perfect layout for a list rpg but there s a subscription you have to pay for literally completely ruins the purpose of the app,1,2020-01-12 07:20:25,0,"Thanks for the review.
A lot of features are free to use in the app. 
Also, I'm planning to add one-time payment option in future."
notifications don t work it s a shame because i wanted to buy a subscription edit okay i already know what s going on the operating system of my smartphone is miui this app s notifications work when the battery saver mode is turned off at the same time in the application settings i have the option no restrictions battery saver doesn t restrict app s activity other applications similar to this one todo habits work with this option and at the same time enable battery saving,1,2019-12-31 06:42:53,6,"Thanks for the review and for clarification on battery saver.
I'll do research on it and try to find way to show notifications with enabled battery saver."
the app doesn t notify me when the task is ready to do please fix it or tell me what to do only when runs the app tasks work,1,2019-11-28 02:27:28,1,"Please check 2 places in system settings:
1. App pages, notifications should be enabled for the app.
2. Battery saver, on some devices battery saver is too aggressive and block notifications from apps, please disable it for Do It Now app."
rs1050 have been deducted from my account twice for yearly subscription but in the app its showing that i have not purchased any subscription yet,1,2019-11-21 01:32:31,1,I do hope that you fixed your issues with the bank and now could change your review as we discussed via email.
it seems the app is not build for longer and more complex use it looks like it can be used for people that plan to follow and develop their behaviour but the level of this app is of a game takes too long for resolving the bugs and no reaction to feedback app crashes when using the calendar options this should not happend when using payed version of the app waiting for improvement or giving up using and paying for this app,1,2019-11-16 02:39:44,36,"Thank you for the review. I'd love to earn 5 stars, so please write to me at liferpgtasks@gmail.com suggesting what I can do to improve."
looks really complicated and it s entirely prescription based i felt like i needed to take a class to learn it there are a lot of apps like this i ll try another one,1,2019-11-14 13:47:09,1,"I regret that you did not like the app, but thanks for the feedback."

i m sure the dev is well intended just no for me ux is terrible,1,2019-10-25 22:26:12,0,"Can you please share which features you find difficult to use? 
And nevertheless thanks for the review."
super cool if you re a dude and want one of the multitude of dude avatars if you re a woman i hope you want to be a nun a woman holding an umbrella over a puppy or part of a couple not even kidding definitely a guy created this app and had an all guy panel of betas,1,2019-09-05 11:00:21,4,"Sorry to hear you are unsatisfied.
It is possible to add your own icon as a hero avatar. Or even make a photo of yourself.
Icons are just quick access examples, you're not limited to use only them."
don t download after installation my calendar was full of commercials you won an iphone events with alarms,1,2019-08-27 14:40:41,1,"Thanks for the feedback. I really doubt that Do It Now caused it, since we don't have any integration with external calendar. We even don't request such permission. Please check different apps or services that do have access to your calendar."
tasks don t update their descriptions until you quit and re open can t set more than 7 tasks without paying an absurdly expensive weekly subscription,1,2019-08-08 21:32:13,6,"Thanks for your review and heads up, I'll take a look.
We don't have weekly subscriptions. Only 1 month, 6 month and 1 year."
read a negative review which had a reply to someone calling out the subscription they said all major features are available for free no no they aren t you can t access the calendar at all it s an entire tab on the bottom of the app it s pretty major in my book,1,2019-08-03 10:04:05,7,"Thank you for the feedback.
Indeed, calendar in subscription only feature. But that's rather advanced app feature which was introduced not far ago.
Major app features in first place are: creation and setup of task, skills, characteristics, rewards, achievements and inventory. Along with that goes a lot of statistics, charts and other free data."
app crashed after creating a daily task with 2 day habit would fail and bring up a warning that the task failed and to press ok however you couldnt tap ok it just did nothing this happened every time gave up and uninstalled the app on a pixel 2 xl,1,2019-07-29 18:09:02,1,A new update of the app is coming soon which fixes this problem. Please bear with us.
the pop up adverts are so loud terible,1,2019-07-21 07:44:15,5,"Really sorry for that, but unfortunately we can't control it. Ads are provided by ad-platform and app can't reduce or mute sounds of it.
Could you please provide screenshots of ads with loud sounds so we could exclude them? You can email us at liferpgtasks@gmail.com."
decent app but repeatedly asking me to pay a monthly subscription for a fancy to do list is completely unacceptable take no for an answer,1,2019-07-19 05:24:49,113,"Thank you for the feedback.
All major app features are available to all users. So you can freely use app without any purchases."
enough with the pop up ads i don t mind if an app has ads but if i m going to be interrupted by a 15 second video every 5 seconds while i m checking off my list i m deleting your app and no i m not going to subscribe just because you keep popping up the subscription page if i have to pay to make the app decently usable you may as well require i pay for it to begin with,1,2019-06-28 09:06:58,9,"We are sorry for this, but to continue work on this app we need revenue from ads. If you don't want to see the ads you can purchase the subscription. We'll also review and decrease ads quantity. Thanks for your understanding!"
very bad experience,1,2019-06-14 07:54:32,1,"Hi,
Based on your review, we cannot gauge exactly what went wrong. Please write to us in detail about the issue at liferpgtasks@gmail.com, so that we can look into it immediately and get it resolved. We would love to give you a seamless experience on our app.
Thanks!"
all right so to be clear this app is amazing and i m really happy to see that someone has made their own version of it even though it s such a great program it became unusable at day one it had bugs and limitations that hindered what i was attempting to accomplish problems such as inaccurate characteristics no quick access from rewards to inventory non removable default achievements inaccurate values on skills after undoing a task and hidden xp multiplier from skills to characteristics,1,2019-06-08 03:20:50,2,"Sorry to hear you are unsatisfied with the app. I hope you can enjoy our app again in the future. Meanwhile we'll work on problems you enlisted to increase app quality.
Thank you for the review."
annoying obstructive ads got fed up after one had a fake x button that was designed to trick you into tapping on it,1,2019-04-26 05:36:33,2,"Thank you for the feedback.
Unfortunately I don't have any control on ads, they are provided by Google Ad network.
Nevertheless, sorry for inconvenience."
couldn t figure out how to set reminder times won t do anything other then am,1,2019-03-16 19:35:17,55,"Thanks for the feedback.
Indeed, time selector shows time in 24 hours format.
Thanks for the feedback. I'll fix it."
kicks me out of the game instantly not for me,1,2019-01-20 19:27:44,13,Thanks for the heads up. I'll try to figure out and fix this problem.
че то вступительного туториала не достаточно чтобы понять что делать,1,2018-12-29 02:14:19,2,"В приложении есть встроенное руководство пользователя, где добавлены подробности практически по каждой функции приложения.

I am trying to fix all bugs that are present in app.
Could you please add more details about bug with rewards editing. I just tried few scenarios, everything working fine."
auto fail only works if you go to each task that s not auto fail makes no sense might as well go back to life rpg that feature was the only reason i even tried this subscription model ridiculous why would i pay a monthly fee for some icons they are helpful icons necessary mostly but that s just ridiculously expensive for some icons a one time fee is reasonable even if it was like 5 i wanted to like this app but this got in the way,1,2018-05-18 10:07:18,4,We're sorry that our pricing model dissapointed you. But it is not mandatory to buy a subscription to use an app. All functions are available in free mode too.
my entire plan was suddenly removed,1,2018-03-31 20:12:16,4,
this is worst task game in my life,1,2017-12-18 16:28:31,2,
the english used is very poor thus if the developed cannot master simple rules of grammar why should i trust them with such sensitive subject matter uninstalled,1,2017-12-17 00:20:40,0,"We're really sorry for inconvenience, but English is not our native language and we will do our best to enhance this part of our app."
somehow bought it s own subscription then i had trouble cancelling was enjoying til it stole my money i never saw any payment authorization window,1,2017-09-26 20:28:55,2,"We really sorry about appeared misunderstanding.
Subscription is automatically prolongated on monthly basis. The price of subscription is displayed as PRICE/month in Remove ads screen inside app and in Google Play purchase dialog. Also, you could cancel subscription at any time through Google Play app or via play.google.com website."
uninstall app that wants sell me every small feature done,1,2017-09-02 01:09:04,3,"We really regret that you don't like our app.
And we really tried to make everything available for everyone. All app features except themes are available for both premium and non-premium users. All the differences are themes and ads. That's all."
one of the worst in the genre,1,2017-08-08 15:15:46,2,"We're really sorry that you dislike our app.
Maybe you could share your thoughts about how we can make it better?"
this app is very very very sexist when you start the app up and go into the icon menu for the avatar of your hero character the vast majority of the icons possibile to select are definitively male worse yet is that all of the ones intresting in thier design or portray something such as the workplace are entirely male the few female icons avalible more than half not even on their own are showing an entirely narrow view with a subservient feeling in thier portrayal the developers of this app should be ashamed of such blatant misogyny,1,2017-02-11 02:08:52,14,Sorry to disappoint you. But you always can use your own picture or even photo. That's just default pack of icons.
i click undo but retain the xp no real theme or this app very bland needs character,1,2016-05-17 18:51:18,1,
way too complicated to use this app could be so much simpler the time i ve wasted on it is time i could be doing tasks,2,2020-10-18 02:34:35,1,Can you please share which features you find difficult to use? Please contact us at support@do-it-now.app.
the app isn t performing very well everything is laggy and when i press any button it takes 10 seconds to load i can still reccomend this app to any avid gamer who s looking for a way to actually do their tasks but it s just too laggy,2,2020-09-14 09:27:53,0,"Wow, that's unfortunate. Could you please contact me at support@do-it-now.app and share more details or even your backup database file so I could check things on my side."
complicated interface adding a repeating task for specific days in the week is very tedious and buggy i added a task repeating mon wednesday friday and it gets added to my list for today saturday ui and ux could really use an overhaul,2,2020-09-12 19:24:32,0,"Thanks for the feedback. I'm planning to work on UI and UX in future. As for specific days of week, yes, that's expected behaviour, you can set first day to any day of week that you like and after first execution task will be scheduled to nearest from defined days of week."
it s not well organized i couldn t organize my schedule nicely i think it should be more simple and easy also reminder didn t work and i don t know why,2,2020-09-03 17:49:18,0,Can you please share which features you find difficult to use? Please contact us at support@do-it-now.app.

Please share the detailed issue by writing to support@do-it-now.app. We'll ensure to look into it with utmost priority. Thanks!"
very useful but completely loses it s value when you don t get notifications of tasks that you need to do even though you put multiple notifications you could get one and none of the others other times you don t even get any i mean how are you supposed to stay on time on certain tasks when you don t even get the reminder please fix this problem,2,2020-07-01 09:41:36,3,Thanks for the feedback. I'll take alook and try to fix the problem.
nice idea for an app but don t like the fact that you can t customize the hero to be a woman also think the interface could do with an upgrade for a better user experience and the app could do with a lot more refining over all to improve it edit but there are no female icons,2,2020-06-30 23:39:25,0,"Thanks for the feedback.
You can set any image for the hero from your device and you can also update hero name. It's all customazible."
a lot of work was put into this i love the idea of it i just got this and i was looking through the app seeing what i can do i love the features and what you can do you can use the app without buying stuff but what your selling it for is crazy 46 for one time purchase is a bit much for a task reminder or 10 20 for half or full year i love the app i would pay for it if payment is 2 49 one time purchase or 12 99 for one time purchase instead of a 6 months,2,2020-06-20 13:02:40,11,"Thanks for the feedback. App has a lot of free features, it's not mandatory to purchase anything at all to use almost all main feaures."
i had the same problem where i started this app in the middle of intense projects and moving so i fell a couple days behind unfortunately skipping dozens of tasks was too time consuming and i don t like leaving a bunch overdue i know partly it s my impatience so i have two stars the other is it just isn t for me,2,2020-06-20 09:06:53,1,Thanks for the feedback. Please consider using autoskip or autofail features. You can setup any task to skip or fail automatically if it is overdue and after specified delay. In most cases these features remove a lot of routine skip\fail actions.
seemed like a great idea could not for the life of me figure it out,2,2020-05-28 10:00:34,1,Can you please share which features you find difficult to use? Please contact us at liferpgtasks@gmail.com.
calendar is a premium feature making this pointless without a subscription,2,2020-04-24 04:40:45,1,"Thank you for the feedback.
Unfortunately app should have a way to monetize to cover app development and support price.
I'm trying to do my best and make as little paid features as possible."
good idea implementation to be revised the management of the task is not clear the dates are showed in a confusing way again the concept is good but the user interface has to be improved and updated,2,2020-04-03 11:48:18,0,"Thanks for the review.
I'll do my best to improve app quality, including user interfase."
ok concept but just takes way too much effort to make the core concept even work on a basic level kind of feels like this kind of an app needs some sort of ai with suggestions for every parameter and sync between different devices to get the basic functionality into usable state,2,2020-03-28 02:39:27,2,"Thanks for the feedback.
I'll try to make app easier to use."
when i checklist today s note automatically overdue s note checked too what s wrong,2,2020-03-25 18:57:49,0,"Some tasks can be shown in multiple groups.
There's an option in app settings to show overdue tasks in Today and Tomorrow groups.
I can assume that it is enabled.
So all your overdue tasks will be shown in both Overdue and Today tasks."
so cool but insanely expensive also wasn t clear how to get started even with the manual i have no reading comprehension issues there is just no getting started section or similar then i saw the fees 50 wow that is high i hate when people gripe that they re asked to pay for apps am a big fan of supporting developers but 50 is nuts this isn t a service one subscribes to ex spotify and 50 is nuts to purchase an app not trying to be mean am fine paying but 50 is way high,2,2020-03-17 08:41:50,11,"Thanks for your feedback.
I have plans to work on some sort of onboarding guide with characteristics\skills\tasks selection from predefined list.
I suppose it will make getting started a bit easier.
Also I'm experimenting with premium purchase, I've added it just last month. So it's price might be changed in future."
a chore to figure out,2,2020-03-14 01:14:00,1,"If you are unhappy with any of the features, you can contact us at liferpgtasks@gmail.com."
notifiction is not working properly when i set a task reminder when it is near finish dead line app doesnot send me task notification about its deadline not working,2,2020-02-24 19:33:19,31,"Thank you for the feedback.
Could you please try to update the app.
I can see that you are using version 2.16, latest app version is 2.22 and I added some fixes for notifications in newer version."
i had to put in all the info,2,2020-02-20 09:13:55,0,Can you please share which features you find difficult to use? Please contact us at liferpgtasks@gmail.com.
one of the most expensive apps i have ever seen or tried everything costs money subscription check paid themes check i mean i spent a fortune on apps and i am in favor of continuous support but still losing my lifetime savings is just not okay reminds me of the app newton mail where they went from free to oh my god this is expensive imo users would sub way more if the options were affordable sorry for 2 5 but if an app is inaccessible due to prices i can t say that it s an ok app,2,2020-02-18 12:44:16,0,"Thanks for the feedback.
Most features in app are opened for use without any purchases. Exceptions are advanced features like calendar and smart tasks and cosmetic improvements - themes, icons, sounds etc."
confusing over complicated and bland looking the fact that i had to go delete the habits that it had already chosen for me made it worse,2,2020-01-05 06:01:18,3,"Thanks for the review. 
Initial tasks are mostly added as an examples of different app use cases.
That's expected that at least part of them will be deleted.
Please share what features you find difficult to use."
i try to set tasks for only specific days of the week but it does not work after i complete the task that s it it s done forever doesn t repeat since most of my tasks need this feature to work the app really isn t good for me,2,2020-01-03 01:34:39,0,"Thanks for the review.
Please check repeats field when you set up tasks. Looks like you set too little repeats and when they were done - task was marked as done."
i was going to give 4 stars but the app does something kinda sleazy where it asks you what you would rate it and only redirects you to google play if you said five stars so i lowered it to 2 stars,2,2019-12-30 02:50:52,97,"Thanks for the review.
Yes, you're right, if users rated app 4 and lower than there's something wrong with the app and we kindly ask users to give us feedback on it to fix it."
i started getting notifications but all came at the same time instead of their specified times so just removed them and no longer use biggest feature i would like see fixed is there seem to be issues with using the today option for the task list widget sometimes will only show one task and sometimes when i can complete all my tasks the next day the list doesn t refresh still says all tasks are done,2,2019-12-29 00:45:25,5,Usually this problem is related to app system settings where notifications are forbidden or to battery saver which could also block notifications from apps. Please double check this settings.
i liked it but most of intresting features was unable until you purchase them,2,2019-11-30 13:08:25,0,"Some features can be opened via referral store.
But unfortunately, app should be monetized in some way to enhance and support it, so there will be features that are available only after purchase."
do you love apps that design their experience to be poor unless you pay ongoing subscriptions for static feature sets that make the experience barely tolerable do you prefer having money siphoned from your account over and over again instead of paying a single small fee once for an app like we used to see then this is the app for you add one more debit to your bank account they hope you ll forget about and statistically speaking you will for a stagnant app you ll forget about in a week,2,2019-11-13 13:04:27,4,
too complicated i spent a half hour looking at the guide trying to figure it out created new characteristics and tasks but on the home page there s no drop down to choose a task when i saw i d have to create one every time i decided to uninstall suggestion create tutorial no one has time for the long guide if we did we wouldn t need a productivity app,2,2019-11-12 22:41:54,6,"Thanks for the review and for suggestion.
Great idea with tutorial."
it is complicated,2,2019-09-18 10:23:29,0,Can you please share which features you find difficult to use? Please contact us at liferpgtasks@gmail.com.
spending 10 once or 5 year for a subscription would make sense to me but paying 15 year to use a to do list when discounted is really excessive this is a great tool actually i love it but i find it ridiculous to pay so much just to temporarily unlock basic features like a calendar edit since writing the above review i ve found cheaper free alternatives the one i m using is called treat yourself it s free and doesn t look great but it serves my needs just right and i love it,2,2019-09-17 03:45:03,10,"Thank you for the review.
Subscription not only allows you to use advanced features like calendar or smart groups, but also allows to improve and polish app. Users interest and support with subscriptions allowed to create a lot of features in the app, including calendar. By the way, right now we have discounts on all types of subscriptions."
price is very high for indian users we don t get 1 10 of what a us citizen gets paid here so there app subscriptions at such prices don t make a sense,2,2019-08-15 10:44:19,0,"Thanks for the review.
Almost all features are available for all users. Exceptions are more advanced features (like calendar) and some appearance enhancing features (like more icons). So you can freely use app without any subscriptions."
is a pretty good app but it s got a pretty big issue which is how is it going to keep track of how many things i ve done every day if it counts the current activity as if it was done the last corresponding day,2,2019-07-13 22:07:54,0,"Thanks for review.
At the moment all your activity with tasks is added to history with date-time when you actually added it. I have plans to add possibility to change this data and time from History section."
quite good one but i prefer single purchase option but seriously i like the statistics well i saw it automatically logs out and not doing backup,2,2019-05-01 23:42:00,1,"Thank you for the feedback!
Could you please add more details on auto logout and backup issue so I could fix it?"
annoying backup system i ve had installed this app and logged in with google account once i also tried some of the app s features but i uninstalled again because of reasons after some times i decided to install it again so i made my tasks and the others without logging in first because i forgot then when i logged in with my google account after that it replace my current data with the older one without warning now all my newly created more complete data is all gone,2,2019-04-29 23:19:10,1,"Thank you for the feedback.
I'll work on backup system to make it more reliable and convenient."
cool idea but it keeps crashing when you try to add subtasks,2,2019-03-06 11:20:57,15,"Oh, wow.
Thanks for the heads up. I'll find and fix this problem."
i m not interested in subscriptions one time fee would be fine by me,2,2019-02-21 10:55:38,1,
kind of ha are to get the hang of maybe i m just stupid idk but i never did figure it out,2,2019-02-07 11:15:43,1,
convoluted way of editing sub tasks and the undo button only works in te immediate moment after checking stats can t be reset all the little thingd take a long time to set up due to the way interface is handled it s also weird how done can t be hidden,2,2019-01-01 19:38:28,1,"Sorry if app disappointed you.
You can undo any task execution from the tasks history (3 dots in toolbar in tasks section, History). Also you can reset everything and reset only the progress in settings."
doesn t do what i need it to do with setting recurring alarms such as every 3 hours forever it just says how many times do you want this to repeat but doesn t let you choose hourly just daily weekly etc,2,2018-12-28 12:57:53,4,"Unfortunately there's no way to setup tasks to reoccur hourly.
Sorry for the inconvenience."
user interface is so tough specially for a new person even there is no guide that how to use on front there r those things which r not useful for a working person like those xp and all don t know how to find week date or tym for an alert not impressive,2,2018-09-05 10:03:31,1,"Thanks for your review.
There's a built-in user guide (open Menu, About, User guide) you can refer to it or simply ask a question via email (liferpgtasks@gmail.com)."
repeats tick now however i encountered another problem there s no way to restore purchases meaning if you subscribe and than reset wipe the app or your phone you can t use the subscription features anymore and to get it back you have to completely resubscribe,2,2018-08-26 18:48:50,1,"Thanks for review.
Subscriptions are bond to Google account. Please make sure you selected same account in Google Play app before installing Do It Now. All your purchases should be restored automatically.
Also make sure you haven't cancelled subscription when uninstalling app, Android will show dialog with suggestion on uninstall with subscription."
the ads on this app are cancerous and the subscription model for this type of app is ludicrous charge a single flat rate if the style does change to flat rate ad free i ll gladly change my review,2,2018-02-08 14:05:45,10,"Thanks for your review. 
Pricing model is under development right now. Furthermore there will be more options."
i really like the application so far great interface and feature set i d really like to see and would even do an inapp purchase for would be a much larger icon set i think being able to group characteristics and skills would be awesome too even better if the group can collapse it would also be cool to see a health bar that represents the amount of time you have in a day to be productive have it decrement as time passes and maybe make it adjustable for how much time you have in a day i think another tasklist app does that overall a great application i hope you continue working on this application edit the app is still decent but taking away the option to just remove ads for a one time price in favor of subscription only has made me decide to stop using this application and change my previous 5 star rating to a 2 star rating,2,2018-01-17 23:08:30,17,"Thanks for review and suggestions.
About subscription. Decision was made to move to subscriptions model and continue development at same pace, previous model was not paying off. 
Nevertheless, you can still use app without subscription since all it adds is no ads, more icons and themes. Other than that all app features available to all users."
so you reskinned liferpg what s different here,2,2018-01-14 06:41:05,1,"No, it's a different app which is under development for more than 2 years right now.
There's a lot of differences - achievements, characteristics, hero statuses, themes, task setup flexibility and musch more."
by default before the current update was rolled out tasks were set to the date today now they are being set to feb 1 3880 how weird,2,2018-01-09 13:18:01,2,It will be fixed in nearest update.
this app is an excellent idea if only it worked i have been unable to move off the home screen without it crashing its a shame as it has a lot of potential,2,2017-10-09 18:44:02,0,
refreshing tasks is a nightmare,2,2017-09-26 20:05:46,1,"Could you please add more details?
We'd be glad to hear about it via mail (liferpgtasks@gmail.com) or here (via updating your review)."
i really liked the app but suddenly from nowhere all of my data were gone one second they were fine then when i connect to the internet it s back at lvl 0 with the johnny avatar it seemed that there was no way to get my data back dropbox saved data seemed to have been overwritten so idk what to do i feel betrayed being immersed in the apo then suddenly left hanging with the fact that i don t even know what caused it,2,2017-09-04 18:42:34,11,"Could you please add more details about Dropbox - have you enabled  auto backup,  or performed manual imports and exports?"
not a movable app,2,2017-08-07 23:17:21,1,Could you please describe your problem and we will try to fix it.
this is not an rpg this is a goal tracker with an avatar ffs so useless,2,2017-07-16 12:08:41,0,
needs a dark mode,2,2016-04-26 13:53:14,4,"Thanks, 
Added to my todo list =)"
almost perfect i only wish it had more to do with the game aspect it s basically a to do list or planner sure it gives you some gold and experience points based on your completed tasks but they amount to nothing as there is nothing to do with either once collected no built in items to purchase no character creation or customisation disappointing that being said the tasks are easy to create and customise i feel more organised than usual so thanks i guess,3,2020-10-27 18:45:29,0,
i really like the depth of this tracker including skills titles really more of an elder scrolls feel and personally seeing myself being lacking in certain skills would motivate me to add more tasks that would improve those i was all set to subscribe and spend too many hours customizing the experience curve all of the tasks and their various skills and really dig into the advanced features but then i hit the deal breaker there is no web interface for this app everything has to be set up on your phone i love having notifications and a checklist on my phone to keep up with repeating tasks habits and to dos on the go but i m looking for an app to add dozens of things to initially and continue adding and modifying as time goes on but to have to do that on my note 20 is just something i m not on board with i need to be able to pull it up on my computer as i m working to check things off or see my next scheduled task by picking up my phone being the only way to check what i need to do it sets me up for failure because my phone is a distraction i m trying to use less while working and since i m working from home now there s no accountability so that temptation to check my facebook notifications is strong if there was a way to open this on a browser and not through some janky android emulator or using my chromebook because i don t use that for work then i d already be neck deep in it but sadly i m stuck using an app that replaces the reward of tracking real life stat progression with digital outfits for your avatar something i couldn t care less about please get a browser interface going,3,2020-10-15 20:10:04,0,"Thanks for the feedback. I'm planning to work on the web version of the app in future, but it will be rather distant futur since I'm the only one developer behind the whole project."
i tried to set task to only do wednesday and friday and it wouldent work so i uninstaled apart from that its a good app,3,2020-10-04 16:50:37,0,Thanks for the feedback. Could you please add more details on it? Does execution of newly created task move it to specified day of week?
not for me i was hoping for something with an alarm doesn t help if i don t get a reminder looks interesting though,3,2020-09-30 05:08:15,0,Thanks for the feedback. Could you please share the OS version of your device so I could try to reproduce it on my side and fix it?
i gave this 3 stars i do like this app and it has lots of potential but i think in execution a few different arrangements would make it more useful for example if the default mode was to instantiate a particular task from a class of universal tasks it would be easier and simpler than managing a list of variables under which tasks are contained characteristics could have sub characteristics as well items could have more well defined powers like delegating the task but not completing it,3,2020-09-14 17:39:00,10,Thanks for the feedback and for suggestions. I do like them all. Maybe except from sub-characteristics since it's basically same as skills.
this app is incredibly unintuitive attempting to create an event with specific start and end dates is overcomplicated i still can t get the specific dates option to function properly in the calendar the app freezes if you delete the preset characteristics this should not have left beta with so many duplication errors please fix this i regret paying for this app edit additionally deleting an occurrence of a reoccurring task only ones previous entries in it s place,3,2020-09-14 13:22:49,8,"Oh no! We sincerely apologize for the troubles you've had with the app. We'd be happy to take a look into this for you, please contact us at support@do-it-now.app. Thank you."
działa ale zwykła aplikacja habits naprawdę wystarczy,3,2020-08-31 18:39:33,0,Thanks for the feedback.
application is superb with only 1 big exception which outguns every good thing duplicate task feature doesn t duplicate any of the underlying subtasks but just links them under the duplicated tasks so you cannot create a template task which could be used to create other similar deep task structures for quicker task creation with similar structures this is a must have feature if you really want to let users use this app deeply and consistently without this i will be forced to look at less,3,2020-08-30 21:57:28,1,Thanks for the feedback. Unfortunately that's the way how subtasks work in the app which allows to add same subtasks to more than one parent. I suppose I can add some sort of deep duplicate feature which will duplicate task and all nested subtasks on all nesting levels.
the app crashes when there are less than 2 characteristics of the hero i like customizing so at first i deleted all presets to replace them with my own but if i delete all characteristics and then try to add 1 new characteristic the app crashes and the only way to get it to work again is to clear all the data and start the app from scratch,3,2020-08-30 17:31:29,2,That's unfortunate. I'll take a look and fix the problem.
this seems like a great app but if you fall off the wagon or take a long vacation with dozens of daily tasks then there s no realistic way to recover because you have to dismiss potentially thousands of pass fails until you can get a list of just current and relevant tasks remaining for today multi select helps but still no good after a summer break or older user with a 12 tasks triggering daily for a year 4380 to dismiss by tapping each one could solve with a select all feature,3,2020-08-26 00:15:32,6,I can assume that you've used older version previously. In current one I've updated auto actions mechanics which drastically reduced number of popups. Unfortunately if such popups was scheduled in previous version there's no way to quickly close them.
starting tasks are not useful for me and creating my own task feels like it requires a degree not at all intuitive i love the idea of it but it feels too complicated and i d have to spend more time setting it up then actually using it,3,2020-08-14 00:27:57,1,Thanks for the feedback. I was trying to make app as flexible as possible so everyone could configure it to suite them best. Unfortunately it increased app difficulty. If you have any suggestions on how it can be improved - I'd be glad to hear them out.
guys i really love this app and feature am bkt confused of putting repeated reminder as am use to it and i love that reminder alarm to make me awake all the time i miss something i can t find that or else please help me guiding for that and also upload more videos on youtube for new users to understand as you guys have hardly any video,3,2020-08-08 22:37:18,0,"Thanks for the feedback. Basically you need to set repeat mode (every day, every week etc.), select number of repeats (finite or infinite) and add 1+ reminder based on task start time.

i don t know how useful this will be yet but i should point out that subscribing to your instagram shouldn t be an infinitely repeatable task xd,3,2020-07-26 19:59:56,0,"Yeah, that's little bug which has been already fixed in dev build. I'll ship it with the nex update :) Thanks for the feedback!"
i really enjoyed the concept used it for about a year and paid what ultimately stopped me from using it is it is not user friendly and glitched constantly it wouldn t keep my settings even though i changed the default or populate tasks on my widget format for setting up recurring events is hard to navigate and it kept duplicating and deleting tasks when using desktop version basically an awesome concept performed poorly i think if more resources were put in to this app it would be epic,3,2020-07-24 21:34:11,0,Thank you for the feedback. I'm constantly working on the app and doing my best to make it as useful as possible.
seems like a really awesome app but blocks stuff behind a subscription or a buy all one time payment would rather pay piece meal it also has ads in the free version that you can t get rid of without the sub or 50 buy all,3,2020-07-16 04:06:37,5,"We are sorry for this, but to continue work on this free app we need revenue from Ads.

fine for daily grind tasks but a hassle for spontaneous tasks not for those who lack patience like the design tho,3,2020-07-07 10:51:19,0,Thanks for the feedback. Is there a way for us to improve the app and get 5 stars from you? Possibly you have some ideas on how spontaneous tasks can be added more easily.
this app is pretty cool and i m trying to get used to be but geez its so difficult to just create the list of repeatable tasks i want to have there s a today tomorrow important section and depending on how you choose to set up your tasks they might not be on any list it s super confusing and aggrivating,3,2020-07-07 05:48:26,1,"Thanks for the feedback. You can change tass groups that will be shown on Profile screen (Today, Tomorrow and Important by default). Easiest way to do it - press edit icon on top of profile screen (pencil iocon) and press on tasks groups button on appeared screen."
the presentation is slick highly customizable and the skills and characteristics offer an encouraging meta to just do one more thing before bed time liking it it would have been an easy 5 star if not for the widgets unfortunately they do not continue the established level of customizability especially rescaling elements of the ui of all tasks to fit it into a smaller screen is missing further there is a bug that all tasks are done after clicking away two tasks oxygen os 10 3 3,3,2020-06-13 09:47:13,2,"Thanks for the feedback.

i really wish this had a website setting this up so far has been a pain in the butt i get maybe they don t allow selecting multiple tasks to prevent cheating or something but it really is tedious doing the same thing over and over again to 30 habits trying to push through it though we ll see,3,2020-05-27 08:21:45,5,"Thanks for the feedback.
I'm currently working on possibility to select multiple tasks (or other items).
In next update some basic actions like skip, duplicate, delete will be available for tasks.
And in future I'm planning to work on more actions for multiple tasks.

If you want some specific actions with multiple tasks - I'd be glad to hear them."
i m sure some of what i experienced could be addressed but the little things kept piling up certain things are on autofail but history shows no failures items that failed passed the day before aren t showing up in history for hours marked something as done but it alerted me to address it an hour later multiple times got notices to perform tasks that weren t scheduled for that day plus others loved this app but finally gave it up,3,2020-05-20 16:02:03,0,"Thanks for the feedback.

You can set task to repeat last 3 days of week, it's basically the same. As bonus you will be able to setup notifications for such task and get notified if end of week is close and task hasn't been done yet."

nice idea with a few issues some tasks never seem to go away whether i say i did them or fail or skip or try to edit they always stay there for the same day also if i miss one day it takes forever going through each missed task and either skipping or failing or deleting or whatever and like i said sometimes that doesn t work fix these issues and i could really get behind using this app,3,2020-04-23 01:30:26,11,"Thanks for the feedback.
Please check task repeat modem looks like task is set to Simple repeats. Make sure sure to change it to e.g. Everyday to make task move after execution.
Also please check auto-fail and auto-skip functions, they will allow to reduce manual effort on missed tasks.
Feel free to contact me with questions or concerns :)"
very user unfriendly with hardly any explanation regarding what the buttons do or the stats mean trying to edit tasks for each day will only let me invent new tasks not pick from a list utterly confusing could have been so much easier,3,2020-04-21 16:25:18,4,"Thanks for the feedback.

same review as rpg gamify,3,2020-04-11 16:59:09,0,Thanks for the feedback.
good app and i like the setups that are already prepared for when u log in my problem with the app is that it s too overwhelming too many things to manage and for my easily distracted and anxious brain it s too much as constructive that can actually be applied please make it so the tasks actually leave the list ocne they are completed some are infinite and its difficult to focus on what needs to be done otherwise good job on this app it s well made,3,2020-04-03 04:26:31,4,"Thanks for the feedback.
It totally depends on type of list (group) and on task setup, there are a lot of combinations of group-task setup, so it mostly depends on users."
i like the idea how it shows my skills but i hate it when it organize the tasks in orders it sets up automatically wherever it wants manual task organizer should be available,3,2020-04-01 23:19:19,2,"Thanks for the feedback.
I do have manual reordering planned for development. But this task is postponed at the moment due to current implementation of tasks and tasks ordering."
this is a re review this could be the best habit tracker goal setter and task manager with some really great features like nested lists and smart auto grouping and a very versatile repeat task setup just don t confuse the game in rpg for any actual gameplay but it does have a very elaborate character design and advancement system that deserves recognition allowing for a well rounded and unique hero which grows with every task performed in the user s daily life however do it now does hamstring itself by overlooking some very important integral functionality firstly there is no way to order the tasks set out in any of the groups after a solid month of use building some projects with subtasks which had subtasks and setting up several habit based routines the lack of prioritisation or task ordering created a confusing clutter of items which looked no different from the next while auto grouping and smart grouping should have been able to help sort that out the lack of ability for the user to remove any task from these groups meant every task appeared once again losing the important ones in the clutter user defined groups could only contain the items specifically placed in them but once again a large project with a number of different aspects can not be ordered into a sensible linear series with no social aspect currently attached to the app as at ver 2 23 0 there is no task sharing there is also no designated pc mac linux front end for desktop syncing finally it s expensive as apps go a one off of 75 will get the full version or about 2 50 a month paid yearly which removes ads and gives calendar access original review a good way to make the tedium of self regulation a bit more fun being able to plan to skip things when away from regular activities is handy it would be nice to see characteristic and skill based modifiers affect related task improvements as they raise and subtask attached leader,3,2020-03-28 14:48:40,33,Thanks for your review and suggestions!
i used to use habitica and i must say this is a great step up i d like to see more social features such as sharing tasks only one person has to perform said task for it to be checked off but only giving that person the experience and gold otherwise the price for subscription is too steep thus resulting in a sub perfect score i could easily justify 0 99 month or eternal subscription for 15 if that price could be met as well as fine tuning this would be easily worth 5 stars,3,2020-03-17 08:30:21,19,"Thanks for the feedback.
I suppose I'll work more on social features in future. Great idea on shared tasks by the way. I was thinking on group tasks which should be done by everyone in a group, but I like your approach more."
as someone who has adhd and deals with executive dysfunction this is a very useful app there are a lot of paywalls though,3,2020-03-05 09:28:57,0,"Thanks for the review.
I'm sorry for the paywalls, but to continue work on this app I need revenue from the app purchases.
I'm trying to maintain a reasonable balance between paid and free features."
was really looking for an app that lets me have multiple repeats for a task within the same day everyday duplicating a task multiple times and then making those into subtasks seems to be the only way but it clutters up the task list like 8 lines so i m reminded to drink 8 glasses of water and then subtasks show up twice in the daily list both within and outside of the main task i thought the repeat every 1 day 8 times custom setting might work but it s a different function,3,2020-03-03 08:32:40,12,"Thanks for the feedback.
You're right, such feature could be useful, but it can't be done at the moment due to technical limitations of current app implementation. Possibly I'll rework it at some point and add multiple repeats."
i like that this app notifies you for tasks but it should respect android system s do not disturb i shouldn t be reminded when i sleeping and i explicitly turn off notifications no other app i have notifies me in do not disturb mode,3,2020-02-23 02:29:34,3,"Thanks for the feedback.
I'll take a look on this problem."
i ve just installed this app and will definitely play with it in the next few weeks it really looks nice and really structured so far my only surprise is that there s no female icon for the person only nuns or dancers but not a simple female icon that doesn t do anything just stands hello is this app exclusively for men or is the icon hidden somewhere,3,2020-02-20 21:13:27,6,"Irina, thanks for the feedback.
I'll add more female icons in next updates.
Meanwhile you can set any icon you like from the filesystem."
i am in love with this app so far i wish there was an ios version available to connect with my friends though i would recommend this to everyone otherwise 3 stars for now due to limited availability,3,2020-02-20 06:18:47,2,"Thanks for the feedback.
I suppose I'll port the app to iOS, I've already started working on it, but there's a huge amount of work to do :)"
this app should be made to work around certain schedules for example people who work the third shift graveyard shift have a completely different schedule than say a person who works a 9 5 7 3 3 11 etc i m certain this adjustment would be greatly appreciated,3,2020-02-12 05:33:04,0,"Thanks for the review and for suggestion.
I'll add possibility to select time when day ends in one of the future updates."
the app is great for the most part i just wish that the notification option for tasks would actually alert me no alarm or even a pop up message i got this to help me remember to take care of certain things due to memory issues but it s not gonna be of any help if i can t even remember i have the app please fix the alarm notification system,3,2020-02-06 02:52:21,69,I understand how annoying that must be. I'm working on a solution. I hope you'll re-consider the rating once I fix the issue.
ads were annoying and it took a lot of steps to set up tasks however it was nifty to use and definitely allowed a lot of control due to the aforementioned steps,3,2020-01-26 11:43:33,0,"Thanks for the review.
Yeah, I've tried to make setup as flexible as possible, but it takes a lot of time for the first time.

this app could be five stars to me what is stopping me is the confusion on knowing just what tasks to do or not to do there s a confusing list of tasks that show up at the bottom and if i did not do them the day before or not click them they just show up there if i delete a task from the calendar on accident what do i do the calendar should be completely removed cuz it s worthless i think tasks should have some sort of streak function or show how many times you have done it in a row,3,2020-01-14 19:32:49,1,"If task is overdue - it will be shown in Today and Tomorrow groups by default. It can be disabled in settings.
If you delete task - well, it will be gone :)
But you can delete task recurrence per specific day if task is opened from calendar for one of future dates.
For streaks - please take a look on ""Generate habit"" feature on task edit screen."
it s a good start i currently have a 1 month subscription needs more habit type features needs to track display and keep a record of current and longest streaks repeat option needs much more options like 1 a way to track a task that s done a certain number of times a day like 3 times a day 2 repeat week should also have the option to have the task done a certain amount of days not just on specific days 3 achievements should have an option for completing consecutive days,3,2020-01-08 23:30:19,2,Thanks for the review and great suggestions.
might be good but it doesn t have task library and trying to set everything up myself is not worth it,3,2019-12-10 01:57:56,8,"Thanks for the review.

very motivational but what s with the subscription fee fifteen dollars a year,3,2019-11-24 02:16:59,0,App can be easily used without any purchases at all. A lot of major features are available in free version of the app.
the fact there are no predefined tasks makes it super hard to use or rather this will work if user can just define the task quest easily or maybe we can import by purchasing some set of quests for me it is still quite confusing and hard to manage with all the options offered would be use it furthere more if not too complicated,3,2019-11-17 16:30:17,2,"Thanks for the review.

ok but doesn t feel too user friendly and kinda weird that the calendar is behind a paywall,3,2019-11-14 18:53:39,0,"Thanks for the feedback.
Calendar is one of advanced features so we decided not to include it into free features set (which include almost all other features)."
i went from touching the app once a day to once a week over the span of about 2 months would be better if notifications were functional could be enabled i like the concept of being a hero though i just always fail all my daily set tasks repeatedly back to level 0 hahaha i stick to my sticky notes app with reminders that i ve been using for years edit 11 10 19 i see notifications on appear on my phone now thank you,3,2019-11-11 03:06:51,6,"Thanks for the review.

On some devices they are disabled by default and app just can't show notifications."
setting things up can be a bit confusing but overall it s good the notifications aren t working on my phone and when setting the task to something that can be completed all day i d like to be able to set times for me to get notifications about it without having to do the weird give me a notification 12 hours before the whole point of me getting a to do list app was to have not only a list but reminders so until the notifications work i ll have to resort to a different app,3,2019-10-19 22:58:33,1,I understand how annoying that must be. I'm working on a solution. I hope you'll re-consider the rating once I fix the issue.
asks for a subscription to get all the features i d pay a one time fee only guess you don t want my money bad enough edit yes i know which is why you got a negative review i like your app i don t like paying subs i raised u to 3 stars for taking this so we ll all to often devs get all butt hurt add a feature to buy a lifetime license even if it s 20 dollars and i ll buy it or give us an option to see ads without a sub at least cheers do this than 5 stars,3,2019-10-18 13:26:46,0,"Thanks for the review.

really amazing but there are pop up adverts if you re not a member and for someone like me that s quite a few adverts daily very annoying but everything else is perfect fyi the designers have to eat so i m not mad but god damn that s annoying would be really cool if you could at least watch a bunch of adverts at once so you don t have to do it later just an idea id be up for,3,2019-09-27 11:03:44,10,"Thanks for your feedback.
That's pretty good idea. I suppose I'll work on adding possibility to watch 30 sec ad to remove all other ads for 1 day and make it cumulative. So it would be possibly to watch e.g. 7 ads and remove all other ads for a week. Will it for for you?"
it would be good if it had alot of tasks that are given by the app accordingly to your interest and even recommend books etc also if there was a competitive mode where you can see what level other players are and that to level up you have to do certain things that can be verified somehow for example read book requires a picture of a book with your face or run requires a tracking through the gps to actually verify yoy ran in this way it can even be competitive,3,2019-08-26 11:25:32,5,"Thanks for the review and suggestions.
Automatic tasks recommendation sounds great, but pretty difficult from development perspective.

good experience nice concept sad that it s not completely free for a to do list and completely frustrating that it keeps crashing everytime i want to edit my level and changing my avatar it went brainfarted when it got overwhelmed by a long list of levels starting from 50,3,2019-08-20 08:40:31,0,"Thank you for the review.

a decent app for its intents and purposes but i struggle to stay invested it s visually good great icons and colours also has a nice selection of skills my biggest issue is the navigation i can t immediately see or twirl down to see subtasks actually marking something as done especially subtasks is a challenge mostly because you face to keep tapping through the task and pages of info to get there perhaps a mind map or something would make it easier,3,2019-08-14 01:59:08,7,"Thanks for the review!
I'm working right now to embed subtasks right into tasks list.
When task in list is with subtasks - execution button will be replaced with subtasks button. Click on it will expand all subtasks right below the parent task. When all subtasks are done - execution button of parent task will be displayed again."
reminder doesn t work,3,2019-08-02 13:48:58,0,"Thanks for the review.
I understand how annoying that must be. I'm working on a solution. I hope you'll re-consider the rating once I fix the issue."
there could be any difference between gold that we earn if my rewards are cheat meal and netflix episode and tasks are run 10 km and read a book it shouldn t be able to get a cheat meal reward for reading a book,3,2019-08-01 04:01:57,0,"Thanks for the review.
I have same thought some time ago, I've even created a prototype with few currencies (gold, silver, various gems), but result was pretty clumsy and hard to set up. I suppose for the mobile app it is better to stick with single currency."
it crossed my mind to buy the full version but then i saw they want a monthly payment why not just make it 5 lifetime seems like a good app not sure who copied who with liferpg seems too similar,3,2019-07-19 22:54:06,0,"Thanks you for the feedback.
We've tried one lifetime purchase but in such case app development and 3-party services fees are completely unsustainable. Subscription allows us to continue app improvement."
very interesting concept but it s extremely time consuming to setup and add all the content you need also being able to edit everything and choose the rewards freely kinda looses it s purpose i understand some people might like the feature but i personally do not overall great app if you have the time to set it up and get familiar with it,3,2019-07-15 03:52:52,2,"Thanks for review!
We are trying to create as much flexible app as it is possibly, but unfortunately it comes at cost of increased difficulty and time to set everything up."
overall a really good app well thought however i would personally spend some time on the interface interactions it became too many steps for my preferences realizing i needed to change a bunch of tasks i had to pick a task bottom right to edit then tap below description untick termless select date click ok top right another ok top right that s too much i suggest adding swiping options to the task look at nine email as an example but overall good might return one day,3,2019-07-07 22:12:31,0,"Thank you for providing your valuable feedback. 
Indeed,  appearance and interactions are not our strong part. But we will work on it."
everything requires you to pay money might as well make it a paid game instead of deceiving people for a free app,3,2019-07-05 21:09:07,0,"Thank you very much for your review concerning our app. All major features in it are open for all users. Unfortunately we can't provide all features for free use, since it won't be possible to continue working on the app."
awesome idea five plus in advance although turns out there are more appealing apps interface wise but non the less it is all about insides not the outside,3,2019-07-04 03:48:18,1,"Thanks for the feedback.
Indeed, interface is not our strong part, but we will keep working on it!"
i love the concept but i would love to see a list of suggested to dos cuz i can never think of things to do,3,2019-07-02 10:44:21,0,"Thank you for providing your valuable feedback. Please reach out to us at liferpgtasks@gmail.com, if you have other suggestions."
the app is great but after using awhile it start to lag,3,2019-06-18 12:08:37,0,"Hey, thanks for writing a review. Sometimes, the app may be slow but such instances are rare. If it happens too often, please let us know at liferpgtasks@gmail.com. We'll have things investigated."
too much paid only,3,2019-05-22 22:38:48,3,"Thank you for the review.
All main features are free to use for all users."
the app itself is a wonderful idea but the interface and functions need a lot of work in my opinion it took me so long to figure out how to set up a habit and i still don t understand how to use a task groups or steps i gave up and came back to my previous tracker because it was too complicated and time consuming to learn how to use this one anyway i will definitely retry after an update,3,2019-05-20 04:11:42,0,"Thank you for your kind feedback. 
You can use built in user guide (Menu &gt; About &gt; User guide) to catch up when having difficulties. But overall I agree that it's pretty hard to figure out how things work."
i really like this app makes life more fun foy adhd brain but sound making ads are a real pain i m okay with the ads in general they don t pop up often enough to be annoying but can we get rid of the ones that make sound so i can stop embarrassing myself in a quiet class room after checking off an assignment,3,2019-03-11 20:22:43,4,"Thanks for the feedback!
Unfortunately ads are provided by Google ads network and Do It Now app do not control them. So I'm not sure if it is possible to make them silent. But I'll investigate this question."
i love the idea of it but currently it s far too complicated for me to use i d love it very much if all the setting rewards and gained skills was a little easier to do,3,2019-03-03 02:08:10,0,"Thanks for the review.
You're right, app is pretty complicated, but that's the price for high flexibility."
it s not bad but it seems greedy like why do i have to pay to unlock individual color themes if i m paying a monthly subscription also liferpg was so much better than this more icons to choose from and they were free if you re going to make an app that copies all the ideas from liferpg at least make it better why can t i make an accomplishment like learned blank piece of music without having to tie it to accomplishing a certain number of tasks or reaching a certain level,3,2019-02-10 03:37:41,9,
this app is great but the setting of the aims and the tasks takes a long period of time therefore it eats up your productivity,3,2019-01-20 16:01:07,0,You're right. That's why I suggest to start small - with only few tasks. Which you will be able to duplicate for similar tasks. This will also help with app mechanics acquaintance.
it actually is a good app but it wont do the one other thing i need it to do which is notify me of a task i set one day it does and the others it doesn t i have reset my phone settings several times because of this looked it up and still no results,3,2019-01-02 13:08:04,8,Thank you for the heads up. I'll try to locate and fix this problem. Could you please share notification settings for the tasks with missed notifications?
i really like the app but i would enjoy it more if there was the ability to manually order tasks through simple drag and drop like in liferpg also if there was a quicker way to edit like in life rpg that would be great i would be willing to pay as a way of supporting you guys but right now liferpg is more practical and they ll get my money until you catch up love the decreasing skills btw,3,2018-12-30 07:02:56,4,"Thank you for the review.
Yeap, will do drag and drop.
Could you please add more details about quick edit?"
its ok notifications dont work very often,3,2018-12-19 01:13:41,1,"Thank you for the review.
Could you please share setup of tasks for which notifications don't work?"
needs fixes like the repetition is screwed also the generate habit looks like the developers don t use it themselves,3,2018-10-12 11:08:34,1,"Thanks for the review.
We're working on habit generation improvements right now, so it will be working better starting from next release.

And could you please add more details about repetition?"
with discipline training apps the market bet is on already diligent people to buy your app with such a small margin of customers you cannot expect success from limiting customization options to microtransactions let alone subscriptions otherwise the app was decent good work credit where credit is due,3,2018-09-28 09:47:19,2,
suggestion can tasks take things from the inventory maybe some items can only be acquired through achievements and those items are needed to complete a task,3,2018-09-26 10:54:14,0,"Thanks for review.

Yes, we need to add items to tasks and achievements as well."
don t like it very much but i think it s just not for me it s very complex and deep with tasks and such i could even set the percentage of fear for a task what so i didn t get very far before i just said forget it my life is too busy for such complexity,3,2018-08-28 17:14:57,2,"Thanks for the review.
Yes, app is pretty complex, but that was the price we need to pay for being really flexible app with a lot of settings. With which users can setup everything to their comfort."
you re good guys your efforts are admirable please consider making the app available to milions of people and support rtl,3,2018-07-17 09:12:43,0,"Thanks for review.
Yes, I have RTL support in development plan :)"
uhm there s a little bug that i encountered i cannot disable the skill decay pls fix i ll give 5 stars,3,2018-05-19 08:00:09,1,"Thanks for the heads up.
Fix will be available in nearest update (2.6.1)"
loved the app but at some point it stopped letting me look at my tasks without instantly crashing so i m not using it anymore i ll be sure to try it again and recommend it to friends if the issue isn t present next time,3,2018-05-06 04:20:27,1,
i really liked the app and had been using it for a few weeks but a while ago whenever i would open the app it would load for a bit but then freeze and crash if i tapped anything the rest of my phone still works fine doesn t freeze while this happens is there anything i can do to fix this i would love to continue using this app thank you and i have tried uninstalling and reinstalling edit clearing did solve the problem for now too bad i had to give up all the progress i made but thank you anyway at least i can use the app again,3,2018-04-02 13:03:37,7,"Could you please try to open phone settings, apps, Do It Now and clear app data?"
it ok gets boring after a while,3,2018-03-28 07:30:27,1,
it was really good for helping me to get motivated for a few days but when i shut my phone off the notifications stop coming until i open the app again and check off something,3,2018-03-24 19:01:40,2,"Hm, thanks for the heads up. We will take a look."
i thought it was a really good app until today it started to crush and i couldn t do anything to backup i lost all of my options to do lists achievements don t know what should i do really disappointed auto back up should be offline too and must be selected when we start to use app or you should use your own database system to backup files not dropbox,3,2018-03-18 23:29:03,4,"Ah, we're really sorry that you lost your data.
Good idea with local backup, totally need to add it."
a intenção é boa mas a interface é bastante confusa the intention is good but the interface is too confusing,3,2018-01-09 02:25:51,1,"Thanks for review. App development is still in progress, so I suppose we will come up with more pleasant design. Do you have any specific suggestions?"
it is a good application it is very useful it is just okay,3,2017-11-02 10:39:13,1,
great app needs a few things like task fail without consequences option mostly a full paid version without subscription or in app purchase not every one has everything connected to internet all the time,3,2017-10-13 02:23:45,1,
it s such a spectacular idea but i had trouble figuring out all of the different aspects and it was just too much for putting in tasks on a day to day basis,3,2017-09-20 02:45:10,1,"We have a guide (Settings &gt; About &gt; User guide).
Also you can write us email with all questions to liferpgtasks@gmail.com - and we will gladly answer them!"
this is ok but it required bunch of upgrade and some new features will keep it but wait till is it perfect,3,2017-08-23 01:52:04,1,Thanks for review. Could you please share some suggestions that will help to make Do It Now better?
good but not ok,3,2017-08-20 08:12:55,1,Please share with us your ideas and suggestion and help us to make Do It Now app better.
everything about this app is perfect except for the widget support the widget doesn t update with the new tasks i make in the app and i wish i could mark tasks as complete right from the widget i would also like to be able to make multiple notifications for one task or set one task to repeat multiple times a day i also wish the notification for the mission would show up every time great start,3,2017-08-17 08:21:37,14,"Thanks for review.
I think we add possibility to perform task right from task list widget. And definitely we're gonna look at widget update problem.
Multiple notifications - added it to development plan.
Task multiple repeats per day - that's a big task from development perspective. Maybe it will be added, but not in nearest future."
are there any guides out there,3,2017-08-16 03:47:56,1,There will be in nearest update.
hey guys this is good idea however i have a feedback for you several times i accidentally was clicking task more than once so i was increasing my level i didn t found related settings i think you should make task clickable checkable do you get me only once per day and highlight the finished tasks this features will prevent accidental checking therefore increasing level incorrectly could you explain me how to use such features if you already have them,3,2017-08-15 20:36:09,13,"Hello.
There's types of tasks that can be performed few times/day. So I suggest you to use Undo button. It is displayed in dialog (along with OK) after you clicked on perform button (with ✔️). In this way you can undo any misclicked task.
If you have any other questions - feel free to mail us to liferpgtasks@gmail.com"
it s a pity that your tasks become overdue not according to your system time,3,2017-07-30 19:25:59,1,"Have you changed system time after task creation?
Please contact us on liferpgtasks@gmail.com"
the concept is good but why the app is not notifying me about thr task even though i have turned the notification on this is very bad,3,2017-07-20 21:47:09,2,
the app is good but a faq would be appreciated for example i cannot find out how to create a group for my tasks,3,2017-07-09 02:33:35,2,"To create group - open tasks list, tap on group selection button at top, tap settings button in toolbar and then + button. In nearest update we will add possibility to add new group right from dialog on edit task screen.
FAQ is under development right now."
this is unforgivably close to perfect why no timer so many tasks are long term and need to be chipped away at bit by bit you could have it where once a task was selected the timer would start and you would earn a certain amount of experience and coin for every x amount of minutes completed as it is i have two pair this app with a different promodo app,3,2017-07-02 03:16:50,7,
but then it started locking up everytime i tried to load it ved it until then,3,2016-12-27 07:55:29,0,In last update we resolved a lot of issue. Please try new app version.
i can t be the only one multitasking therefore i don t have time to figure out a basic program i put in a picture and it was so tiny i put in my tasks yet some are timeless some are daily and there was powerlifting i m physically crippled,3,2016-12-07 17:40:43,4,
my settings kept on changing ever time i reopen the app for example fear is set to zero when i open the app again fear is set to 80 why please fix this it s getting tiresome to re do the settings over and over,3,2016-10-14 11:22:03,1,"Thanks for reply.
This bug is already fixed, fix will be available in next update."
its almost what i was looking for apart from is there a way to set how much xp is required to advance in level and how much xp completing a task will give you e g i want to make it so i start at level 40 in benchpress and achieving 91kg will put me at level 41 i will reach level 100 in benchpress by the time i can do 150kg completing 120kg would put me on level 70 etc otherwise the numbers are just meaningless to me really i want to set it up so when i reach my goal in each thing i am at level 100,3,2016-08-26 03:17:19,3,"I'm sorry, but no, there are no way to set xp required for level neither xp gained by task. It's slightly different system based on importance and difficulty (and fear in future) of task."
but can t really test this out since i m tied with habitica oh yeah i personally don t like the avatars though it d be nice if to upload your own avatar oh just saw other people suggest the same lol,3,2016-08-10 20:21:23,1,This feature will be available in next update. =)
it really helps with getting things done receiving xp gold and different skills makes uninteresting tasks much easier to do i like that on the contrary to other apps it is actually useful without having to get the premium version though the premium version is a nice addition suggestion some rewards could already be existent so you don t have to come up with them yourself i personally don t have many ideas for coming up with rewards and don t know what gold price would be appropriate,4,2020-10-25 17:36:41,0,
i need help from dev one of my favorite apps of all time combines scheduling and rpg gaming in one not 5 stars because i bought premium but when i logged into my kindle premium status didnt show up neither did my other data from my phone please help devs,4,2020-10-17 01:47:17,0,"Kindle is not fully supported, since app uses Google Services for some operations. Please contact me via support@do-it-now.app. I'll try to help with your problem."
nice app with lot of options like the reward system developper look active as i read the reviews and take comment into consideration what is fear doing in the task don t really understand ui could get some work not possible to have reminder on ad vitam eternam task don t know if possible to have multiple reminder for the same task but would be usefull maybe a better tutorial don t like wall of text for tutorial something more interactive would be nice would love to have reward separated per group for example i am eating healty all week long i can have a burger i am stopping smoking do sport i can have a new phone what would motivated me is a picture of my reward that get slowly fullfilled as i get closer to my goal very expensive app,4,2020-10-09 03:01:25,11,"Thanks for the feedback. Fear is representation of your hesitation before starting the task, e.g. how much you don't want to do it. Yes, you can set upto 5 reminders per task. And thanks for the great suggestions!"
i normally don t leave reviews but i think this app is great i love the chart wheel thing i think it would be cool to set the characteristics and or skills chart week thing as an option for widget on the phone screen however it s been more than a week now since i sent an email to support and i haven t received any help back concerning my account please get back to me as soon as possible also i will leave a more nice detailed review in the future once i get into using it more,4,2020-09-23 11:31:19,15,"Thanks for the feedback! Great idea with chart wheel widget, unfortunately Android system doesn't give tools to create such complex widget. As for email - at the moment I've answered to all emails. Please check that you send email to correct address - support@do-it-now.app"
just staryed using it there s a pretty massive learning curve especially when it comes to the complete customization of your character characteristics skills and in general finding the flow that works for you but so far it s been really helpful and an enjoyable experience,4,2020-09-16 12:47:13,1,"Thanks for the feedback. Indeed, learning curve is pretty steep. Feel free to contact me at support@do-it-now.app if you'll have some difficulties. By the way, is there something I can do to get 5 stars?"
so far just setting it up is very easy for me the gaming aspect of it is very appealing for the adhd side of me i wish i could get the full version but that will have to wait until i get a job thank you so much for creating this app,4,2020-09-15 09:57:04,1,"Hi, is there something we can do to get 5 stars? Please let us know at support@do-it-now.app."
was really good but i think it d be even better if it had a widget that could just take up a whole screen and mark complete on tasks from there,4,2020-09-03 19:28:56,0,"Thanks for the feedback. Do It Now has 3 widgets for the desktop. Task list widget is the one you're looking for, you can select tasks group for it, stretch it to whole screen and perform your tasks with it."
my favourite to do app but the price of subscription is hilarious,4,2020-09-03 03:08:38,0,Thanks for the feedback. Subscriptions price is based on cost of third party services and cost of app maintenance\improvement.
ivery good app i would recommend it,4,2020-09-02 19:12:47,0,"Hi, is there something we can do to get 5 stars? Please let us know at support@do-it-now.app."
i like alot about this app but really want to add one thing to make it round out my gamify experience skill tree i would love to be able to lay out and plan how my skills level up and progress into other skills linking them together and seeing how the diverge and converge some skills may need levels to unlock from other skills or need a basis in 2 skills to be usable it really would make this app a huge step above any other gasification app,4,2020-08-31 00:17:25,3,"Thanks for the feedback and for great suggestion. As a gamer myself I really like skill tree idea, but I do want for skills to be independent from each other. Since otherwise it would pretty hard to use the app."
it s a pretty good app it makes me want to do tasks unlike other apps,4,2020-08-30 04:37:50,0,"Hi, Thank you for your comment. Is there something else that we could do to deserve a better rating from you? Let us know at support@do-it-now.app."
i absolutely love the app i ve had it for a short time but i know i ll love it this app helps me keep my day organised and be productive in a fun way the reason for 4 stars and not 5 is simple so much more room for work and improvement in all directions keep up the great work my personal request is a bit of work on the inventory system as it would be great to keep track of that too the need for quest rewards for items is a bit wonky but my only complaint so far,4,2020-08-26 14:44:15,12,Thanks for the feedback. You can add an inventory item as reward per task execution on task editing screen. After that each task execution will grant specified inventory items along with usual XP and gold.
pretty decent but it ignores my default repeat value and honestly the interface for setting a reminder date time when creating a new task is clunky and needs to be smoother,4,2020-08-26 14:03:00,2,Thanks for the feedback. I'll try to improve it and make a bit smoother.
i m loving it so far is there any way to switch out the icons with some on the file system,4,2020-08-19 01:29:51,0,"Thanks for the feedback. Unfortunately no, you can select only from the predefined list of icons."
how i add multiple user profile,4,2020-08-18 13:20:34,0,Thanks for the feedback. Unfortunately only one user profile is supported at the time.
it crashes when you complete a task,4,2020-08-08 21:52:28,0,Thank you for the feedback. Unfortunately app hasn't been tested on chromebooks and we can't guarantee 100% compatibility. Nevertheless I'll try to locate and fix the issue.
for me is one of the best ways to do stuff and feel like it has some sort of meaning,4,2020-07-29 01:28:19,0,"Hi, is there something we can do to get 5 stars? Please let us know at support@do-it-now.app."
really a fun and somewhat complex habit tracker to have recommendation you could include some fantasy quests and creatures and some kind of algorithm that uses the skills i made to be used in finishing the quests and fighting creatures maybe like dice roll mechanics would be fun to see your skill in use cos just building them up isn t enough good job add this quest system and its a complete app also app generated loot too,4,2020-07-27 16:13:06,0,"Thanks for feedback. Yeah, I had the same idea with quests (or maybe bosses) which will depend on skills\characteristics, but I haven't yet worked on it."
regarding the last review i noticed that multiple widgets of different lists lead to the emptied list glitch happening more often unrelated but i really love the idea of the new batch action feature just wondering why i can t use it to batch fail or batch perform more than one task i expected that to be the point but only batch delete and batch skip are available batch fail would help with one of the biggest issues to making the app fast to use which is that failing takes like 3 taps,4,2020-07-21 08:22:49,25,"Thanks for the feedback.
Looks like widget issue doesn't depend on tasks group and appears for any group.
I haven't yet fixed it unfortunately.

As for batch perform and fail, I'm planning to add such possibilities in one of the next updates."
i love this app its helped me quite a bit i would love to provide 5 stars but i m having issues with no notifications even though i have them active and the widget is a bit fussy clearing randomly when i finish a task i really hope these get fixed because then this will be the single most useful app i ve ever used,4,2020-07-18 04:05:29,8,"Thanks for the feedback. Please check that app is whitelisted in system Battery Saver, on some device it could block app from showing notifications. I'm aware of the problem with widget. I'll look into it and try to fix it."
allows me take some of the real life out my responsibilities,4,2020-07-16 06:34:40,0,"Hi, is there something we can do to get 5 stars? Please let us know at support@do-it-now.app."
really really i m struggling a little bit with some details but i m loving so far,4,2020-07-11 20:35:13,0,Thank you for downloading our app. We'd love to help you. Please write to us at liferpgtasks@gmail.com so that we can help you better.
some integrated examples would be nice also an inventory of items to help pick rewards but i have no income so i have to miss out on the good stuff,4,2020-07-09 03:35:00,0,"Thanks for the feedback. Indeed, I'll add some examples in rewards and inventory section."
so far so good trying to get in to it,4,2020-07-05 12:29:31,0,"Hi, is there something we can do to get 5 stars? Please let us know at liferpgtasks@gmail.com."
tasks in all tasks group is frequently disappearing reappearing so kindly fix that bug otherwise app is great,4,2020-07-02 21:45:31,0,That's unfortunate. Thanks for the heads up. I'll try to find and fix this problem.
love the way this app is helping me its great feature is the way we can track our own progress because of reward system 4 stars only because of app s free theme,4,2020-07-01 10:24:17,0,Thanks for the review. That's unfortunate that you didn't like main app theme.
perfect for me takes some serious investment to set up proberly but absolutely worth it however the impact of skill increases on characteristica is not calculated properly and totally different percentages turn out with the same fraction of exp or identical numbers with a totally different fraction of the exp further more when i use a task that gives me 100 exp my herolevel gets stuck at 90 25 and doesnt update anymore if these minor bugs are fixed i will provide the 5th star,4,2020-06-30 00:29:40,0,"Thanks for the feedback. Skill to characteristic impact formula is not really straightforward, but the idea here is to add some motivation to increase skills to higher levels. More details on formula here - https://www.reddit.com/r/DoItNowRPG/comments/g1qk7c/magical_formulae/ As for hero XP - indeed, that's a bug and I'll fix it. Thanks."
i love this app i only wish it had a sort of multiplayer for families to connect accounts,4,2020-06-21 16:08:06,0,Thanks for the feedback. I'm planning to work on more social features in the app. Likely the first one will be shared tasks - tasks that can be added and performed by the both users.
this app is almost everything i want i just wish there was more of an rpg element i played habitica and it didn t quite scratch that itch either maybe something like small quests that utilize text and dice rolls that can be improved based on your level in different categories i d enjoy the hell out of that and would happily pay for expansions additional quests stories etc,4,2020-06-17 22:41:45,7,"Thanks for the feedback. Well, currently I'm planning to focus on general app fearues, but I do like idea of some quests or bosses. I'll possibly work on something like that later on."
really awesome app i think the best one the only it lacks web version since it takes kinda complicated process to create and manage all this tasks and habits with web version it would be much easier,4,2020-06-17 17:17:30,0,Thanks for the feedback. I'm planning to add web-version in distant future. For now app is only available on Android.
it seems good but there is no way for me to increase the art category music and drawing are not the only forms of art please change this maybe change art to crearivity but certainly add more creative pursuits so those who cannot draw or do music can increase it also aren t erudition and learning really the same thing my conclusion is that this app is great but needs a lit of work,4,2020-06-16 14:36:31,3,"Thanks for the feedback. You can change any characteristic or skill in the app. Default characteristic\skills are added just as example, so it could be easier for new users to start using the app. So feel free to chage ""Art"" to ""Creativity"" or add any other skills besides drawing and music. High flexibility is the virtue of the app :)"
strong fallout skyrim feel but full buy price is 45 even those games price are lower on sale and i bought them on sale other sold apps price are usually below 5 dollars and the default free theme has nice green background but paid ones only have bright white background i don t sub apps i buy them sub is for something like netflix and spotify,4,2020-06-13 20:13:23,0,Thanks for the feedback.
add check system count system how many times and timer count down and count up then no need to use other apps tnx,4,2020-06-13 13:36:44,0,Thanks for the feedback and suggestions.
this app is very good for keeping on task and everything is totally customizable one thing i would improve is the simplisity of it right now it s a bit too much to handle and if there was an easier way to do things it would make this app even greater,4,2020-06-10 06:39:11,0,"Thanks for the great feedback.
Indeed, sometimes it's pretty difficult to use, but in same way you have high flexibility.
In any case, I'll try to make app a bit easier to use."
i have enjoyed navigating my way around the set up so far definitely worth a subscription for the full experience shared it with friends but unfortunately it s only available on android one major issue though is i can t select the quantity to use for consumables if you decided to put in 1 000 credits in there you ll have to click 3 000 times to use it takes the fun out of it also wish it had a web page version like habitica so everyone can share the experience regardless of their os,4,2020-06-10 04:15:08,10,"Thanks for the feedback.
Unfortunately there's only Android version at the moment. I've started working on iOS version, but it will take a lot of time to do it.
As for consumables - yes, there's no bulk use action at the moment. I'll add it to development plans."
i ll give it five stars when the widget stops resetting to nothing after i alter things within the app i have to delete it off of my screen and put it back on in order for it to update,4,2020-06-05 22:09:53,0,"Thanks for the feedback.

the pop up after u conclude a task is very exhaustive if u take off these the app would be perfect and also if u stay a day without doing the tasks the app goes crazy and stop placing the tasks correct,4,2020-05-26 15:44:01,1,"Thanks for the feedback.

in primo luogo adoro voglio dire una lista che mi faccia giocare ed avanzare di livello come in un rpg non posso fare altro che adorare tanterrimo in secondo luogo probabilmente esiste un modo per impostare orari per le attività lezioni cose così altrimenti non avrebbe senso poter impostare un allarme ma hem io non ho idea di come si faccia help me please cosa numero tre ho provato a cercarne una versione adattabile per pc e non sembra esserci sarebbe bellissimo se ci fosse e magari fosse sincronizzabile ultima cosa e poi la pianto esiste un modo per creare traguardi composti da più traguardi mi piacerebbe avere un megaobbiettivo laurea composto dei vari esami o campagne composte di varie sessioni,4,2020-05-20 19:06:44,0,"Thanks for your feedback.
1. 😊
2. There are a lot of setting. Open task edit screen and explore, fields are clickable and there's also button at the bottom with additional options.

app has improved a lot since initial launch and it s still my go to for my daily tasks still hoping for more social features in the future also there is still the lingering issue with a surprising amount of battery use i think it s still related to the amount of tasks i have i have a very busy schedule and it causes my phone to overheat keep up the good work,4,2020-05-16 21:22:47,0,"Thanks for the feedback.
I'm planning to add at least few social features in future. Though existing ones are barely used.

i absolutely love this app i am using for a couple weeks and it is really helping me with my tasks i tried similar apps and they re not quite as good tasks are highly customisable and gives tons of options so why not 5 stars well there are some issues but please take them as constructive criticism 1 it is not respecting the silence mode 2 steep learning curve worth it though 3 auto failing task with subtask is not working i will promptly give 5 starts when 1 is fixed,4,2020-05-12 20:04:33,36,"Thanks for the feedback.
1. I've applied few fixes for the app to work correctly in silent mode. But silent mode could behave differently on different device. I'll look deeper into it.
2. Yeah, that's the price that we paid for high flexibility of the app. I haven't figured out how to improve it yet.
3. It should work, I'll take a look."
personally taking the time to translate my every task into rpg format is tedious pretty time consuming in terms of customization it s more like an rpg maker but to do style it s not what i m looking for but given the developers perspective it s excellent for what it s worth flexible extremely customizable and full of possibilities suggestion allowing to download other users formats they ve already taken the time to create,4,2020-05-08 15:42:31,0,"Thanks for the feedback. You're right, it's a bit hard to set everything up gor the first time. But when it's done day-to-day maintenance is not that big deal. Unfortunately setup difficulty is the price that app paid for high flexibility.
Thanks for the suggestion, it's tough task from development perspective and I'm not sure if I ever get to it."
great but have some issues with the tasks list widget no way i can complete a task on it without its disappearing,4,2020-05-02 16:35:30,0,"Thanks for the feedback.

it s a good app looks polished and nice only problem i have is i have some tasks that repeat themselves even after i complete them i ve editted that they only come once a day but forever stay on the today tasks,4,2020-04-24 15:56:58,0,"Thanks for writing a review.
2 cases could cause such behavior:
1. Task repeat mode is set to Simple repeat which prevent task from moving to next repeat date after execution.
2. Task is overdue. If task is in past it will be automatically shown in Today group. You can disable this behavior in app settings."

i ve really enjoyed the app and has been very helpful although to me the app seems like it s not fully finished i wish the stats you were building actually did something in game the money also seems kind of pointless i can buy items that i create but they just adjust your stats which i could easily accomplish through tasks,4,2020-04-18 00:05:06,0,"Thanks for the feedback.
Do It Now is more like self-motivation and statistics tool. You can create your own setup to track tasks, rewards etc.
It was intended to give user high flexibility, so user could create and complete as much tasks as needed."
it is a lot better than the other apps out an 8 or 16bit ui makeover would be dope the pixel look and feel always nostalgic,4,2020-04-14 23:10:00,0,
haven t used it much but so far i enjoy the idea i would like to suggest adding a notification every so often option for example i m wanting to do 12 pushups every hour every day 10 hours a day,4,2020-04-13 07:11:08,0,"Thanks for the feedback.
That's great suggestion, but I'm not sure that it will be added to the app in near future since it's huge effort from development perspective."
a bit underrated it s a fun way to get things done kind of like having a video game character it does take time to set up and some unnecessary options cost money but it makes getting stuff done feel more rewarding good app for parents to set up for their kids as well so they are more motivated and enjoy getting chores homework etc done,4,2020-04-11 10:51:05,0,"Thanks for the good feedback.
Is there something that I could add to the app to get 5 stars?"
it s a great app and very useful but i would like for it to add an options delete after completion this means it would repeat until you hit the check button,4,2020-04-07 18:38:15,0,"Thanks for the feedback.
You can just set task repeat mode as ""Do not repeat"" or set it to repeat only once. When you execute such task it will be marked as completely done and won't be shown anywhere except ""Done"" taks group and tasks execution history."
app has definitely improved since my last review more social features would be really cool i am subscribed and i would love to see where this app takes off i have noticed recent stability issues when i m on the app for a prolonged period not sure if it s related to the amount of tasks i have as i use this app for basically all my tasks including birthdays the app will slow down and nearly crash after awhile otherwise this is still my go to 4 stars again,4,2020-04-02 19:05:11,27,Thanks for the feedback. I do have plans on new social features and I'll try to improve app performance for cases with a lot of tasks and other items.
this is a great app for anybody needing some extra motivation or a way to organize their life i ve had some trouble editing or deleting reoccurring tasks but this may be a device issue i m not sure,4,2020-03-30 23:45:01,1,"Thanks for the feedback.
You can edit all recurrences of the task at once via Tasks section (in bottom navigation menu).

add negative habits which when done decrease coin xp etc,4,2020-03-14 21:08:25,1,"Thanks for the review.
I'm not planning to add negative habits (I mean generation), but you can make any task negative. To do it just set more decreasing skills, just make sure that sum of all related skills impacts is less than 0. If so - task will be considered negative and you will lose XP and gold when task is performed and gain it when failed."
nice app bug with achievement exp gained it only adds on to current hero exp without leveling up eg 144exp 25exp why does skill decay even after doing a task that increases it,4,2020-03-10 23:52:48,0,"Thanks for the feedback.
I'll take a look on bug with XP. Looks like hero level could increased only by 1 at a time.
Skills decay is not related to executions, it was designed in that way. So you will lose skills all the time and will need to perform tasks to get it on same level or higher, same as in real life."

i am liking it the subscription model is a bit steep and harsh especially for the full buy out at 50 dollars a suggestion i d like to see two categories under the skills one that says increasing and one that says decreasing i am trying to set up a daily grind negative skill that decreases will power and motivation while increasing submission and routine i ve noticed the dev team is really good at responding so i am hopeful for a response thanks,4,2020-02-26 18:04:08,12,"Thanks for the feedback.
Yeah. I'm trying to answer all reviews, emails and messages :)
I thought about adding skills with negative impact on characteristics, but it will complicate app a lot more. Both development and usage parts. So I decided not to add such feature now. Maybe I'll reconsider later."

it s helpful but it s also annoying edit i didn t make it clear enough it s annoying to realize how much i m failing lol anyway the app is pretty good i m just overly sensitive and self criritcal,4,2020-02-24 19:11:17,0,"Ah, got it.

good app lots of customization but i have noticed an issue with repeating sub tasks if a subtask is set to repeat it won t complete the main task seems to complete fine if the subtasks are not set repeat,4,2020-02-22 22:39:21,0,"Right, it's tricky.
If you have subtasks which repeats - the only way to complete parent task is to make sure that all subtasks execution dates are after parent execution date. In such case parent task becomes completable."
i like this app but it really annoys me that it defaults to playing a chime when you first pick up your phone in the morning when just checking the time i don t want to be woken up even more i wish it were possible to just disable that notification instead of disabling all sounds from the app at once,4,2020-02-21 21:26:38,7,"That's a good suggestion.
I'll add option to disable sounds for specific actions."

i think it s a great app and a lot of fun i had some trouble figuring things out at first but everything works the only complaint i would have is the cost it would be nice to have some of the features but they are too expensive,4,2020-02-17 20:39:25,2,
the app is allready great the amount of customisation is surreal and with a bit of tweaking you can really make it work the sentimental value you create this way really helped me grow as the app is rpg themed those elements could be further enhanced imo i think a customisable character would be fun more options to spend the currency other then personalised awards is what im getting at this way you really build something with the effort you ve put in for the games keep up the good work,4,2020-02-17 16:54:08,16,"Thank you for the review!
Great suggestions on customizable character and currency. I'll try to come app with something :)"
this app is great i love the idea of turning my daily life like an rpg game but i have this goal to wash my face twice everyday and it feels repetitive to make two task for the exact same thing so can you guys make a task where it has to be done twice before the said task is completed been trying my hardest to do this on your app even finished reading the user guide but it still wouldn t work,4,2020-02-13 05:55:59,2,"Thanks for your review.
Unfortunately there's no way to schedule same task more than 1 time per day.
Due to limitations of current implementation it's pretty tough task from development perspective, but I suppose I'll add it in future."
i really like it i think it s a really cool concept to have characters to build up with the habits only thing i wish were there is to be able to have notifications for term less habits,4,2020-02-12 17:41:08,0,"Thanks for the review!
Unfortunately due to current implementation there's no way to schedule notification for task without date/time."
the app is good and in general highly customizable but it has one flaw it uses days 24 hours periods as a basic unit of measure but it doesn t let you change the default starting hour midnight this is inconvenient for people who have unusual working hours and it makes the app impractical to track daily tasks for users who are more productive at night i would rate it as a 5 stars app if i could choose when my day ends and be able to log my dailies properly,4,2020-02-06 12:09:28,7,"Thanks for the feedback.
You're right, possibility to set day starting hour might be really useful."

I'll try to add it in some way :)"
it is a cool app but the calendar feature required to be bought that should be informed to the users before installation in addition it would be a good idea if skills can increase over time and skills can decrease characteristics,4,2020-01-22 23:05:45,1,"Thanks for the review and suggestion with calendar.
Skills do impact characteristics in both ways - when skill level changes it will also change levels of all related characteristics with specified impact.
Also there's an option to enable skill decay over time, so less usable skills will have less value over time. Like in real life."
great honestly great way to keep track of daily tasks to stay organized one thing they should add is overall goals and tasks leading to those goals,4,2019-12-10 08:49:21,1,"Thanks for the review.
That's interesting idea. I suppose it could be useful.
Meanwhile you can create a tasks group per global goal and add related tasks to it."
interesting concept still getting used to the functionality but this app is an effective way to gamify your to do and task lists before do it now rpg i had a list of chores now i have a quest list instead time to go unlock some achievements,4,2019-12-08 23:24:19,0,Thanks for the great review and good luck with achievements!
this app is so robust i love it however i would love a quick add button in the notifications,4,2019-11-24 23:41:39,0,"Thanks for the review.
Wow, that's a great thought. I suppose it would be useful to add special notification that will show first task from some selected tasks group (e.g. Today), number of tasks in this group and ""Add"" button which opens new task screen quickly."
i just started but really like it so far competes directly with habitica but less of the nonsense costumes it s hard at first to sort characteristics skills and tasks you are essentially your own game dev but on paper i recently sorted out what i want to improve skills and what is stopping me characteristics tasks will follow soon after i m really hopeful about this setup i love the design and i never do this but i might actually pay for a subscription if all goes well,4,2019-11-23 07:42:01,11,"Thanks for the great and encouraging feedback.
I do hope that app will help you to achieve your goals :)"
perfect for people who want to get organized and desire an app more robust than a checklist it has profound customization ability the reward system is more complex than competitors for someone with significant attention issues this has really helped me to feel invested subtasks and autofails are great features would be 5 stars if developers 1 allowed subtasks to renew as collapsible tasks not just tied in 2 made tutorial videos full functionality will be a learning curve for many,4,2019-11-20 23:13:44,54,"Thanks for the great feedback and suggestions.
1. Will work on that!
2. Great suggestion, I have plans on adding more small in-app tutorials (like on Inventory screen at the moment). Video also could be a cool way decrease learning difficulty."

I'll work on UI and UX :)"
just after i looked at the interface i knew it was what i was searching not so for the xp thing which is a very great idea but also how it handle goals like reading books for anyone who think in terms of goals and obviously who love rpgs it s totally free though,4,2019-11-10 15:45:43,0,Thanks for the great review!
its a good app for everyday tasks it takes time to customize it and its normal because its an rpg type however i think im not the only one who encountered this annoying bug where if you want to change a task from lets say termless to always repeat every day the task remains termless you can solve this problem by deleting the task and making another with the setting you want this bug was very frustrating because i thought i did something wrong but yeah,4,2019-11-06 23:51:40,3,I understand how annoying that must be. But I can't reproduce this bug on my side. Maybe there's some additional steps required to do it?
complete a tip the task option directly reduces the characteristics rather than just the ability,4,2019-11-04 21:11:43,0,"Thank you for the great review!
Skills and characteristics are related, when you perform a task it increases skill, which also increase all related characteristic :)"

i was looking for an organizer app which would provide statistics on my discipline and progress and this does it but it is missing one to me basic feature the tasks don t have a start time or duration period there is only a deadline it doesn t allow understanding easily whether the tasks overlap in time is this feature available in the premium version at least another missing feature is the location setting at least at a home work outdoors level any plans to incorporate the features,4,2019-10-28 03:50:30,2,"Thanks for the review.
No, there's no duration or start time in premium version.

the app has a way of motivating you to complete tasks,4,2019-10-17 18:32:40,0,Thanks for the great review!
it keeps reminding me even after the task is done and it was adjusted according to how many times i should be notified but overall nice app,4,2019-10-07 10:19:09,1,"That shouldn't happen. When you open Profile screen (first screen on app open) all scheduled notifications should be cancelled and only valid one should be rescheduled.

i ve been using this app for some weeks now there are still some features that i don t understand and there s just so much available for customisation that it s overwhelming but once i spent a few hours customizing all i wanted this app has been so fun and useful most to do list apps out there are so cumbersome and anxiety inducing this one isn t it has helped me prioritize what s important to me while letting me role play i like it a lot,4,2019-10-02 11:53:41,3,Thank you for your feedback.

pros it s fun lots of customisation all basic functionality are free inclined to habit generation than everyday to do list cons first time setup are quite challenging literally create your own system icons themes are limited minor inconvenience i was using liferpg which seems abandoned now so it helps with the learning curve i see devs made lots improvement here recommended,4,2019-09-12 06:44:20,30,"Thanks for the great review!

Yeah, learning curve is pretty tough, but that's the price we need to pay for high flexibility."
hello this app is great but i have a suggestion with the inventory items please make it so you can give them attribites such as 10 xp gain or 10 gold gain or just 10 xp for a specific skill,4,2019-09-07 22:25:26,0,"Thanks for the suggestion.
I have exactly same idea in development plan :)"
this app looks to carry the torch from the now abandoned liferpg app and from a bit of digging so far i m impressed some things are tucked behind a pay wall such as the calendar and aesthetic additions like themes and icons but it s a relatively low price and helps support the devs so i ll probably bite on that once i ve set up everything and used the app a bit one suggestion i d have is to implement geotagged triggers for events like bringing up a reminder when i m near the gym or store,4,2019-08-21 17:47:33,7,"Thanks for the review and suggestion with geotagging, I'll investigate the possibilities :)"

Yeah, I've been thinking to add some sort of task templates or as someone suggested tasks packs that could be driven by community. It should partially solve the problem."
it s one of the best liferpg apps i have ever seen with lot of options but it can have some more beautiful transparent widgets and if you add an option that a task directly influences a characteristics it can be more comfortable,4,2019-08-08 08:58:33,2,"Thanks for your review!
I'll work on new widgets in future.

fun and productive,4,2019-07-29 10:23:59,0,Thanks for great review!
i bought the full version its a fun app to challenge yourself i would like to see an update gives you the choice to choose a pen or pencil icon or a book icon which seem to be missing that would be useful for example if you want to write a book it would be nice to have a book icon or pen icon or pencil icon update i seem them now thanks for responding and letting me know looks like i needed to scroll farther down to see them,4,2019-07-27 04:57:05,0,"Thank you for the review.
You can find 4 book icons under Other section of icon selection dialog.
Also you can use one of two brush icons which are placed under Tools section.
Update: I'd really appreciate if you increase review rate to 5 starts. If you have no other concerns or suggestions of course :)"

I'm already working on fix for it."
i downloaded this game in the hope s that the format would help me with my procrastination and can i just say its exceeded my expectations it s so good i ended up having to change some of the pre set tasks and rewards to make it more personalized but apart from that it s great highly recommend if you like me like to procrastinate and make excuses to avoid tasks,4,2019-07-07 06:32:25,2,Thank you for your feedback. Please reach us back if we can do something to get 5 stars review.
its really useful i really wish it had a way to add people so you could submit tasks for eachother or a way to access it on a computer or browser,4,2019-06-30 05:32:19,0,"Thank you for your feedback. We are going to implement possibility to add people to friends list and suggest them tasks in future. Not so sure about desktop or web version, can't give you any concrete answer about it at the moment."
it s a lot of fun good personalization i have to make time to explore the app called more fully i think a tutorial would be amazing and pre developed lists that could be tweaked,4,2019-06-21 11:01:20,0,"Thank you for your feedback.

fantastic app but 4 stars every part has been a comfortable experience for me until i started trying to use it across devices i took me around 30 minutes to set up all my tasks the first time and when i signed into my account for the app all the tasks i had made got overwritten by the default tasks from the other device it was partially my fault for the careless order that i signed in on the devices but perhaps my issue could have been avoided entirely if when it attempted to sync my tasks from the internet the first time it asked me if i wanted to use the database that is from the internet or that is local would have saved me a lot of headache remaking all the tasks again that said every other function provided is great and i would recommend,4,2019-06-13 08:54:48,2,"Thank you for your feedback.
That's pretty good suggestion, I'll add it to development plan."
new user and i m impressed a lot of neat features i ve been looking for in apps like this it s obvious dev is active and listening and thats a great sign if i have an immediate suggestion it d be for us to be able to add tab categories of traits besides the default characteristics skills for example to add things like personality lifestyle or however we want to organize our skillset categories so those 2 sections aren t cluttered a search option for icons too maybe keep it up,4,2019-06-13 02:50:57,11,Thank you for your feedback and suggestions!
life changing app with a great concept but still needs some work,4,2019-06-12 07:00:34,0,With every new app version we are introducing new features and improving existing ones. We are sure that your feedback will only help us improve further.
liking it a lot so far but i don t get it doesn t give a warning ring before tasks i put in that s kind of the main thing i need it for to remind me of tasks i had previously put in,4,2019-06-12 03:31:48,0,We are very sorry for the confusion. We will solve this problem as soon as possible.
fun and easy to use creative and helpful way to track tasks and habits,4,2019-06-07 05:52:26,0,"Thank you for downloading our app. We'd love to earn 5 stars, so please write to us at liferpgtasks@gmail.com suggesting what we can do to improve."
one thing the widget sometimes doesn t update the today list and about the to do list i have to make 2 different widget for today and tommorow because when all tasks show cannot differentiate what today and tommorow so i was check list my today and tommorow task and it is kinda confusing how to uncheck again maybe this option to check and uncheck must be there and the reward will be given after all the task has done for today thank you hope this app improve,4,2019-06-07 02:19:15,0,"Thank you for your kind feedback. 
I suppose adding task start date to widget could solve problem with distinction.

You can uncheck executed tasks from profile screen if task was performed today (first tab in bottom tab bar); or you can open executions history and undo task from there (tasks tab, options menu at the toolbar, history)."
i can t sign in neither with my google account nor with gmail should i do something to be able to do that or it s just a bug,4,2019-06-05 09:16:58,0,"Thanks for review.
Looks like an issue with login. I'll look into it.

Thank you for your comment. Is there something else that we could do to deserve a better rating from you? Let us know at liferpgtasks@gmail.com."
this app is really good i want to suggest to that the app should have a rest day option or something similar that you can activate it anytime you want and while activated the tasks will be put into a halt including penalty and overdue it is useful if you are on vacation or there s an occasion you need to attend and makes you unable to finish the daily tasks,4,2019-05-27 14:33:43,12,"Thank you for your feedback. 
Good suggestion, thank you!"
this is pure magic juat saying best life app out there keep up the great work im ao happy you listen to your customers edit now my entire household is using this app its amazing magic easy to use only thing i noticed is that when you claim a reward if it has an increasing cost sometimes it will spend the gold after the increase instead of before resulting in extra gold loss my best guess is that the script might be changing the cost value before subtracting the gold from the players gold,4,2019-05-24 18:52:10,0,"Thank you for your review and heads up on problem.
I'll fix it in nearest update."
hello your app is amazing my gf and me installed this app 2 days ago and started to planning task to each other but i really need a list functional like add a shopping list or some book list to add in this app are you going to add this sry for my english btw update and i really need a functional to add a checklist in tasks with possibility to mark it s completed thank you and your team again for this great app,4,2019-05-05 04:04:36,2,"Thanks for the review.
Not sure about lists, maybe I'll add then some time later. For now you can use subtasks system for such things."
it s a bit hard to set everything up but it s a fun new concept for the typical agenda that encourages you a bit more to achieve your goals through a rpg style nice work dev team thanks for your time and effort,4,2019-05-04 00:09:50,0,"Thank you for your review!

I've updated Portuguese translation. It will be available in nearest update (today-tomorrow)."
this app is great overall i just wish there were categories for your inventory items and that the task list widget showed your profile icon also the profile icon has very bad quality when you choose your own,4,2019-04-23 10:57:40,2,"Thank you for the review and suggestion.
Will do!"
keeps me on track,4,2019-04-23 06:25:39,0,Thanks for the feedback!
i like it and i would definitely pay 20 for it but i cant justify paying a subscription if only i could pay once,4,2019-04-17 08:42:21,2,"Thanks for the review!
I've tried single purchase model and it's not convenient in this case.
Nevertheless, all major features are available in free version."
all it needs is the option to set a pic from the gallery as an icon if that happens in the next update i ll give 5 stars,4,2019-04-07 20:57:24,0,"Thank you for the feedback!
You can set hero icon from file system. But not item (task, skill) icon due to implementation and due to possibility to set colors to icons."
notifications fixed app keeps getting better i d like to suggest being able to use habit generation as an unlock condition for achievements edit nice d another thing i would suggest is add the date when an achievement was unlocked example unlocked 01 04 2019 so we can also order them by this date when looking the unlocked tab thanks for this app,4,2019-04-04 17:23:34,21,"Thanks for the review!
Good suggestion. Actually I have it planned for future."
great app for setting up to do list and setting skills very similar to liferpg differing only in ui and the addition of achievements in my opinion stuck with the other one of the basis of not wanting to pay a subscription for an app would prefer one off payment to unlock features,4,2019-03-07 21:29:30,1,"Thanks for the feedback!
All major features are available without subscription. So it is not mandatory to buy it :)"
needs more ranks,4,2019-03-06 00:55:36,2,"Thanks for the feedback!
You can add as much ranks as you need. Just open hero page, press edit button and then edit hero statuses."
productivity gamefied as has been said before the natural successor to liferpg looks like they just ripped the source code tbh but it irons out many of its predecessors bugs pity they monetised it in every available orifice fukugly full screen ads in app purchases for trivial customisations and an absurdly extortionate subscription all conspire to overshadow the app itself as does the uninspired graphic design and the use of unexciting headings that detract from its gaming usp,4,2019-02-28 06:39:55,4,
a good app in general i would love to be able to have loose tasks for example practice spanish twice a week which should be completed at least twice every week also why not allow icons to be any emoji,4,2019-02-19 17:19:36,1,"Thanks for the feedback!
I'll add 'loose' repeat mode to development plan.
In next update I'll add possibility to select color if icons, so they need to by with only 1 color to work properly and it's clashes with emoji usage."
it s pretty nice all things considered but i have found a few problems with it mostly the fact that the notifications do not work and by that i mean no matter how many notify alarms i set none of them go off i ve downloaded this app on several occasions in the past and i ve had the same problems each time the second is that the widget will quite often display that i have no tasks when i in fact have about seven on any given day i m not taking a star off because of the widget though,4,2019-02-15 02:33:02,2,"Thanks for review.
I'm working on notification fix and I hope it gets fixed until next update.
Widget wasn't updated for some by now and is a bit laggy. I'll try to fix it also."
it s a great app keep up the good work it has almost all features i ve ever wished for in gamification but a few things were missing quite annoying for me and lead me to abandon this app for now if it helps you i could write you a comprehensive list of enhancements and features that i think could make this app better here s not enough space for that though please give a short answer of you d like me to send you an email with the list of my thoughts,4,2019-02-14 09:09:48,1,"Thanks for the review.
Sure, I'd be glad to hear ideas and suggestions!
You can email me on liferpgtasks@gmail.com."
i liked the app very much i signed up and so with the hope that my to do list would sync with all devices but when i reinstalled the up after cleaning my phone everything disappeared,4,2019-02-12 21:21:15,1,Unfortunately cloud sync is not yet ready (working on it right now). Please consider using sync via Dropbox or export data locally to your device.
no bad habits to simply punish me just could make good habits,4,2019-02-12 19:07:14,1,Unfortunately no. But you can create negative task and execute it every time when you done something which strengthen your bad habit.
looks cool and i like the stats i would like to have a monthly and yearly calendar display on which dates with non repeating tasks scheduled are bold or otherwise highlighted or preferably have the tasks listed in small font in the box for that day in monthly view and when you click on the date have all tasks for that day display why do none of the life rpg apps i ve tried not have calendars it s bothersome to add something to a calendar and then open up another app and add it in again,4,2019-02-04 06:21:07,9,"Thanks for the review.
I have calendar planned for future development, at least weekly and monthly views. It's quite big task and I need to drastically rewrite some apps part before starting this task, so it could take some time. But there will definitely be such feature."
so far so good i love creating my own adventure still learning some of the functions maybe a tips video could help i can t wait to see what other fun things can be added more community or friends list or leader board then get us to do in app purchases for new items or level streaks i just like this a bunch so thank you,4,2019-02-01 20:57:39,43,"Thanks for cool review.
Big features planned for future are: full backup of data to cloud server (optional, of course), friends list and tasks assignment to friends and calendar with all future and finished tasks."
seems like a very good idea but how can i edit what i ve done the previous day eg if its tuesday it seems to be impossible to edit achievements from monday which seems like a perfect thing do to on tuesday morning,4,2018-12-18 12:02:18,14,"Thank you for the review!
Well, in most cases it can't be done. Only valid case is for tasks - you can undo task execution for Monday, edit task and execute it again. But new execution date will be Tuesday (today)."
a very good rip off of liferpg taking all of the useful features of task management reward motivation and rpg style stat levels and making the ui simpler and more user friendly seems to be monetizing the idea though putting in ads and lots of in app purchases and requiring a recurring payment subscription rather than one time purchase to unlock features,4,2018-12-03 08:24:54,2,"Thank you for the review.
Subscription helps to keep app development process running, but you can use almost every feature of app without subscriptions. Exceptions are less icons, less color themes, less notifications per task and few more. But main features are free :)"
good concept but i don t use the app anymore as someone who is now not really a gamer the point game like concept seems to doesn t work for me anymore and maybe it s also due to the fact that i only compete with my self if i were to compete with a friend or whoever that is maybe i can keep my self accountable but that s it to it if you are a gamer this app might gonna help you,4,2018-10-26 12:56:44,0,"Thanks for your review.
Yes, app designed mostly for the people who are into ""gaming"". But I'll keep in mind your advice and will try to add some spirit of competition to the app."
this would have been a 5 star to app if it wasnt for one miner problem i didn t like you can t choose pm or am times and it s just a annoying and confusing,4,2018-10-24 08:33:54,0,"Thanks for the review.
Yes, I'll work on switching between 12H and 24H. Thanks!"
i like this app i only used it for 5 mins and there are no adverts that ruin your experience i hope that the developers will continue working on it so that the app will be improved i would consider paying for the premium features too if the app is good enough,4,2018-10-15 19:57:41,4,Thanks for the cool review!
i really like it i wish the icon could be custom made for example if i could use my own png files as icons that would be cool especially for achievements,4,2018-10-12 13:35:18,1,"Thanks for review.
For now there's no possibility to add custom icons support due to current implementation. Maybe in future I'll rewrite this part and add this feature."
why this app consumes so much traffic in background this month it hit the 500mb in bg is this app free of malware elements,4,2018-10-07 10:48:56,1,"If you downloaded app from Google Play - there's no malware in it.
Have you logged in into app? Have you enabled autobackup to Dropbox?
Looks like some error."
you add execution note but when i check in history it just one word that appeared and the next is i confuse how to check the details hope the next update there is detail preview when tap a mission that s done in history and also search feature in history will be very useful to check some mission among all those missions in history thank you for great app,4,2018-10-05 01:45:53,4,"Thanks for review and suggestions.
I'll work on them."
fun way to track and reward yourself guilt free lots of personal calibration but the interface is nice my only problem is the lack of icons even in the premium section,4,2018-09-21 19:47:32,1,"Thanks for review!
We will add more icons in next updates.
Do you have and specific icon requests?"
update thank you for the fix also if possible can you consider adding an icon a way for quickly go to subtasks it helps user experience a lot because now we need to click hold 2 times for go to subtasks of a parent task and it takes a lot of time for the tasks with many level i already update the rating please let me know your feedback for the above and when the new update is available i will change it to 5 stars regards please fix the add subtasks feature in subtasks list of a parent task when clicking on edit icon it show list of subtasks to select and a add subtasks link but click on it show nothing it affects user experience a lot because when we need to add subtasks we need to back a lot to go to main task list then add normal task then go to parent task to mark it as subtask thank you it is urgent so please let me know your feedback then i will increase the rating,4,2018-07-08 15:06:36,4,"Thanks for the heads up on this bug.
I'll fix it in nearest update.

UPD: Fix is ready and will be available starting from version 2.7.0."
reward section should be devided into multiple catagory like item armor food etc to avoid difficulty in selecting one we want to buy with gold or you could add the feature to add a tast to costomable group we can create,4,2018-06-29 14:25:12,2,"Good point. Thanks.
I'll add it to development plan.
I suppose it will be in same way as tasks groups."
i like this update however i still think this app could be better in ui in future could you add the visual improvement like adding progress bar in each characteristics and skills so we can track our progress more fun also just suggestions you could add health and magic point like in real rpg game alot people would like that i guess,4,2018-06-29 11:44:59,2,"Thanks for the review.

I agree on progress bars for skills\characteristics. And probably it will be optional settings.
You meant progress to next level or overall (higher level - higher bar)

Health/magic. Well, I don't think it will be very useful in this app. Maybe in future, after inventory capabilities extension there will be some point in it."
great app not as streamlined but ever so flexible a couple of annoyances i have with the app are the lack of icons even after purchasing the locked icons and the lack of color coding grouping on the overview,4,2018-06-11 16:22:31,2,"Thanks for review.
I'll add more icons.
If you have any icon suggestion - please use this Reddit thread: https://goo.gl/tcWD3Y."
excellent features but needs more exciting ui,4,2018-05-22 13:52:49,1,"Thanks for review!

I'll work on UI, but in general it will stay ""simple"" :)"
i quite enjoyed this amazing little app for a week then i realized i can t view my past before like 6 days if i could save it somewhere in graph form that would ve been the 5th star,4,2018-05-18 23:51:16,2,"Thanks for review!
Well, I'm not sure about graph exporting, but I suppose I'll add option to extend daily statistics up to 2-3 weeks.
I suppose it will be a field in settings with possibility to select number of days."
it s a good app but it would be better if more optiosns were added in the repeat section like being able to choose the repeat to occur every second third etc day week etc,4,2018-04-20 14:11:59,2,"You can setup repeat in that way right now =)
Just tap Custom button when dialog with Every day,  Every week repeats is displayed. At the top spinner select needed interval (day, week etc). And type needed amount in input field. Please contact us on liferpgtasks@gmail.com if any difficulties or use built in user guide (Settings, About, User guide)."
so what is the function of coins,4,2018-04-02 05:19:16,1,"The function of coins is to reward yourself with some prizes in Rewards section.
In future you will be able to buy some staff and store in inventory also."
this is a great app the organization options are perfect for what i want to do i put each room of my house in as a daily bonus quest and add each task i need to do as a subtask that way i can see the tasks needed for each room at a glance and give myself a nice bonus for full completion my only complaint is that you can t set a custom reset or rollover time it s always at midnight local time sometimes i like to lay in bed and check off all the chores i did before falling asleep and if it s past midnight it becomes a pain to fix would be great if the option for custom reset time was added,4,2018-04-01 10:31:30,11,"Thanks for review and suggestion.
Gonna consider manual set of rollover time =)"
would give it full stars but the app crashes as soon as i open it now so i can t use it hoping that will be fixed in an update edit for some reason i can access the app through the widget and edit the tasks but as soon as i try to click the home page it fails to load and crashes,4,2018-03-22 12:09:54,2,
i love most of this the initial setup is a bear of a thing but once that s done it is very satisfying to use as with all task management apps i wish you could have tasks repeat on only certain days of the week e g weekdays or m w f the first app to do that will make bank,4,2018-03-13 19:59:31,3,"Thanks for your review!

With Do It Now you can schedule your task on specific days of week - just edit task, press on date-repeats, press on repeats, in appeared dialog select custom,  in top dropdown list select every week. Here you can select specific days of week to repeat your task."
does this app has a web version yet if so then i ll definitely use it more,4,2018-02-24 17:33:22,1,"We're sorry, but no.
App almost fully lives on mobile device."
really like this app i ve found it really useful would have been 5 stars but i ve started having problems with adding skills to tasks with some of them not appearing after saving updating this does affect the game aspect and relevant skill increases,4,2018-02-21 01:27:32,1,"Thanks for review.
We localized and fixed this bug.

Problem is with skills with same level and difference in XP smaller than 1.0. All other skills can be easily added.

Nevertheless, fix will be available in nearest update (probably next week)."
first app to actually motivate me only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that the achievements have no automatic templates and can t be set with conditions connected to the auto fail function that would be great for building habits,4,2018-02-02 18:37:32,1,"Hmm, could you please add more details to your suggestions. They're very interesting.
You can update your review or contact us via email on liferpgtasks@gmail.com"
i love everything i just want the xp bar to have a cool animation of actually filling up in front of me it s the only reasons i still use rpg life i know it s petty but animations are important for an app,4,2018-01-25 22:52:13,2,"Thanks for review.
Well, yeah, we do not have much of pretty animations, need to work on that =)"
like it so far my only suggestion being a shop where you can buy icons or something gotta put use for the coins,4,2018-01-23 04:31:01,1,"There's Rewards section where you can add your custom rewards and buy theme with coins. It's sort of self motivation mechanism, when you earn coins by performing tasks and then purchase a reward for your hard work with tasks =)"
excellent for what it advertises i wish for a way to spend the gold or use the exp that way it would provide incentive to play more for those who wish to use this app as intended,4,2018-01-19 03:41:32,1,"App is development process is still ongoing. At some point there will be more game features.
If you have any specific ideas - please reach us with them via email - liferpgtasks@gmail.com"
this app has helped me so much with motivating myself i m very ill and doing simple daily tasks like eating and taking meds is exhausting this app has made it easy to track when i meet my daily goals and helps motivate me to do the things i need to take care of myself my only dissatisfaction with this app is that you cannot edit failed tasks on many occasions my goals have timed out because of the auto fail feature and even though i have done the task and thought i told the app i had done the task the app tells me i failed the goal once the task is failed there s no way to edit the failed task it s really upsetting when i ve done the work but my goal is marked as failed for now i think i will stop using the auto fail feature,4,2018-01-09 15:42:08,15,"Thanks for review.
We will try to come up with some sort of undo process for auto-failed tasks."
i really like all the features in this app but what i have two problems with this app simplicity and customization the app lacks simplicity in that it s a bit hard to get started i create a task and i m introduced to skills which introduce me to,4,2018-01-06 07:15:09,1,
this app so far has the cleanest ui of all the apps ive tried of this genre the task set up is so quick to use and the duplicate feature fantastic for someone like me who has to set up working out tasks with similar outlines the one thing i d say is additional icons and maybe a few templates to help people get started other than the default otherwise keep up the good work,4,2018-01-04 03:17:15,1,"Thanks for the good review!
We will totally gonna add few more icons. In fact we are planning to add new icons every new update =)"
i really like the idea of this app it s pretty easy to use and understand and if you liked d d growing up it ll remind you of the character building levelling processes which is great if i could make one suggestion add a falconry guy to the avatars,4,2018-01-01 17:35:12,1,
great app a funny way of keeping your life organized i would suggest some better graphics more icons for tasks are definitely needed a hp bar to show how much time is left before sleeping which should be an adjustable parameter and an inventory feature to store your purchased rewards without immediately using them when used they would disappear from inventory and maybe appear in the claimed section thanks for the hard work keep it up i will give 5 stars for sure as soon as these features are implemented,4,2017-12-27 01:17:29,2,
great app only thing that needs work is the achievement tab it s pretty lackluster you can t make achievements for reach x level overall like giving yourself an achievement for reaching level 5 as a hero not only for skills carachteristics how it is currently would change to 5 stars if this gets fixed,4,2017-12-24 11:43:31,1,
achievements should have reward options such as exp gold otherwise it is a neat app,4,2017-12-18 15:03:30,1,
i ve previously written a review as well as updated it which i will continue to do i believe in this app s potential one of the more persistent problems i ve faced is with skill point distribution sometimes when i go to check the related skills of a repeating task because i m not seeing the related skill points on screen upon completion i notice that the related skills percentages have been reset i have to manually change the percentages back which can be pretty time consuming especially when it keeps happening i really wish the devs would fix that also a suggestion i would love to see time date for my tasks in the widget and notification windows,4,2017-12-17 20:18:03,6,
приложение хорошее однако было бы неплохо добавить календарь чтобы можно было более наглядно просматривать записи на послезавтра послепослезавтра 31 февраля и т д а также было бы неполохо добавить срок выполнения задачи в течении определенного периода а не только на конкретную дату,4,2017-12-12 12:52:58,2,"Спасибо за идеи.
Мы, вероятно, добавим и календарь и начальную дату для задач в будущем."
autofailed tasks should be more intuitive they don t actually fail until you visit your task list and if you failed them yesterday the points for the day you failed them don t go to that day they go to the current day so because i slacked off yesterday i m starting today with like 20 gold on my chart that s not fair and it skews the stats if i didn t do something yesterday i want it to show that i didn t do something yesterday and when i autofail a task it should alert me with a notification or at least as soon as i open it to the home screen and tasks should be able to be set to just autofail at midnight without having to fiddle with the current more involved settings,4,2017-11-26 21:52:52,23,
great app but when are they going to make some ice hockey icons,4,2017-11-20 03:38:06,4,We'll try to add them in next update =)
upd пожалуйста добавьте возможность уходить в минус по итогам заваленных миссий получается нечестно что я батонюсь пропускаю задания а потом мне не нужно отдавать за них долги очень мешает золотая иконка монеток не вписывается в дизайн сделайте ее пожалуйста в одном стиле с приложением только не меняйте на алмазы p s купила тему чтобы немножко поддержать вас очень жду заявленного обновления ______ перешла к вам с liferpg очень не хватает функции добавления иконок для миссий в идеале кастомных с галереи и родительских дочерних миссий хотя с ними сопряжено большинство багов мне очень нравится приложение а главное его отзывчивый разработчик я продолжу пользоваться спасибо,4,2017-11-12 09:55:52,1,"Иконки для задач и подзадачи были добавлены в текущем обновлении (наконец-то :) ).

Уходить в минус - мы отказались от этой идеи, так как не бывает отрицательного уровня навыка или уровня героя. Разве что с золотом можно сделать, что-то вроде долга =)
В общем, еще обсудим с командой."
a bit of headache in beginning but awesome,4,2017-11-11 06:45:47,1,
it was great while it worked fell in love with this app but after maybe a week of using it stopped working a bug perhaps but when i went to add tasks it froze and didn t let me do anything and even deleting and reinstalling didn t help i m sad that i have to replace this app i really did like it a lot,4,2017-11-07 22:57:24,3,
great app an alarm would be great with new or better icons in context with the app,4,2017-11-03 04:32:52,1,
i really like the idea and would of easily voted 5 on it but it has no alerts or alarms on mine to remind me to do the set task doesn t even send me a notification,4,2017-10-27 06:06:33,2,
this is a good app for motivation,4,2017-10-26 02:01:24,0,
i like the app as a to do list however it needs an am or pm function on the time,4,2017-10-18 17:41:53,1,
i believe it s awesome but for the next update can you please use instead of in front of numbers it looks like a minus symbol,4,2017-10-16 20:51:22,0,
it was fantastic until it started freezing every time i went to tasks is there a way to fix this,4,2017-10-15 21:56:00,0,
i m only a few days in but it seems to be working only complaint so far is that it would be good to have the xp show on the task list next to the task or have the gold reward automatically scale with the xp so i have motivation to do the harder for me tasks without having to work out how much gold i think it is worth,4,2017-10-10 23:52:38,2,
although a very useful app i would like it to have a more medieval rpg theme to it rather than the modern theme that it currently has i would also like to be able to set some skills and characteristics to decrease over time aside from that the app is great,4,2017-10-08 04:31:56,1,
love the app i wish there were more features such as adding icons to tasks or adding a quest map,4,2017-10-05 20:16:37,2,
widget finished task should be gone it bother me that it s still with my task at hand,4,2017-10-01 03:40:22,2,"Yes, this bug is fixed and will be available in nearest update :)"
nice app best of the ones ive tried but really think about adding some graphics and a much less boring ui look at superbetter for instance also a multiplayer aspect is a glaring omission that almost all your competitors have try to have stats actually have some meaning or a way for us to give them meaning,4,2017-09-23 01:44:36,34,
edit for some reason the timezone of the app is not the same as my actual timezone tasks are overdue even though the day is not over for me however it s still a great app with lots of potential i like the slick interface and the whole concept once you can differentiate the characteristics from the skills the fun begins keep improving this app it s definitely my favorite rpg lifestyle app,4,2017-09-15 08:24:31,24,
could we customize notification sound for successful tasks i want to add final fantasy victory theme but still don t know how to besides that i really like this apps,4,2017-09-07 13:20:38,2,
as someone that has played several mmorpgs i m excited to use this i made my first task for cleaning the kitchen and worded it in a way you d find in an rpg quest simply for self amusement i think it would be a really cool update to have our hero icon image start off as a type you d see in an rpg such as ranger mage or paladin and maybe even more to pick from in novice armor related to their character type and as the hero goes up in mastery their armor would get better,4,2017-08-28 07:44:38,3,"Thanks for the good review!

We have some ideas concerning hero images evolving with hero level ups and I think we will add this feature in future =)"
just work on the notifications they are working rather strange and add some better visualization,4,2017-08-21 05:38:04,1,Totally gonna work on them. Thanks =)
hi im using nexus 5x as a gamer i definitely like it however nowadays while i m checking making task the app always crash not responding i only rate 4stars because of it kindly fix thanks,4,2017-08-17 06:44:31,1,We're gonna look on that. Thanks for heads up.
by far the most in depth app of this style tried habitica and others and they were so underdeveloped in comparison in my opinion,5,2020-10-27 03:09:43,0,
this app is very customizable which i definitely wanted in an rpg style to do list however it does come at a cost since getting everything set up how you d like takes much longer than similar apps personally i think the trade is worth it hence my rating but be aware that if you re looking for something more simple this probably isnt the app for you if you want to really determine exactly how you want things to work pick this one over the others,5,2020-10-26 22:53:33,0,
it would be nice to have the ability to set an xp coins decay until a particular task is completed also would be nice to be able to more easily schedule an existing infinite repitition task for a particular time rather than editing its time and resetting it or duplicating it also maybe add search ability for filtering icons as there are so many,5,2020-10-26 20:12:16,0,
the most fully featured task tracking app i ve seen a little daunting at first i recommend ignoring a lot of the xp sliders and special options until you are used to the general mechanics once you realize you can ignore or tweak any mechanics you dislike it s value shines through there s enough options in the mechanics that you can use what systems you like and ignore the rest,5,2020-10-24 22:26:10,0,"Thanks for your review!

good app relatively easy with out being too simplistic rpg aspects are engaging but not excessively time consuming calendar is paid access which is a little annoying but certainly understandable popup ads are mostly brief as should be and far enough between they are acceptable enough all in all best rpg todo list i ve tried,5,2020-10-18 21:52:39,0,"Thank you for providing your valuable feedback.

awesome reminder app this one actually motivates you to complete tasks because it shows you your progress and the ui is easy to use it s very customizable from being able to choose the icon of a task to allowing you to create an unlimited number of tasks the free version also allows the use of almost all of its features and doesn t hinder you in any way i m considering getting a subscription but mostly because i want to support the creators of the app that has improved my daily life,5,2020-10-10 00:33:48,15,Thanks for the feedback.

this has been the most straight forward gamify your life app i love that it lets you add your own skills and have a task increase or decrease a skill i also like that it allows you add your own pictures for each different level that you advance as you fulfill your taks improvements needed would be to explain the metrics percentages and other customization that is not entirely clear how to use,5,2020-10-06 23:27:13,3,"Thanks for the feedback.

love it incredibly useful and i feel like a superhero growing in a gamification style system that tracks my lifestyle and productivity great product the only thing i need is an online opportunity it is hard to use the interface exclusively on the phone because it is such an interactive interface this would really expand on the product usage i can t pull my phone out at work but could open a website,5,2020-09-23 19:04:26,0,Thank you so much for your review!
excelente app e com possobilidades infinitas se você for criativo,5,2020-09-21 17:02:12,0,Thanks for the great feedback!
absolutely love it this is by far the greatest app for gamification i use this app to implement new and creative ideas in notion i wonder if the developers know about notion and gamification setup in notion it has been a huge help,5,2020-09-19 18:18:52,0,"Thanks for the feedback. I use Notion really occasionally, mostly for books tracking but I haven't heard of gamification setup in notion."
tried 3 top rated at time as once a pen paper dungeon master i found this app to be a nice blend of functionality and fantasy the interface is user friendly and sub screens are nicely inter connected easy to navigate would benefit from a little more initial guidance particularly with specific intended use of the various percentage settings and groups sub tasks but overall so far very happy wish calendar wasn t paid but certainly understand so far no obnoxious ads,5,2020-09-16 04:35:58,25,"Thank you for providing deep and great feedback!

edit this one complaint has been fixed its perfect now i really love this app and i use it everyday the new black and orange theme is really nice to look at my only feedback is that i wish the color of the widget changed to match the chosen in app theme because the yellow list kinda sticks out from my background other than that the app is perfect thank a lot levor,5,2020-09-10 21:38:56,6,"Thanks for the great feedback! I've done my best in fixing widget color to switch with app theme, but sometimes it still gets stuck on some color. Possibly that's some sort of system problem.

i have only spent a day with this app but i know that i will spend a great deal of time with it in the future pros highly versatile and fast this app can be designed to fit any goal and can be tuned to fit any rpg balancing you want nearly everything is customizable it s also fast from first tap of the app to checking off accomplished tasks it takes just a couple seconds cons perfecting the customization to the rpg experience you want can take a long time but it s worth it,5,2020-09-09 07:08:51,5,Thanks for the great and so much detailed feedback!

i love using this app for myself to help me prioritize organize my time for school homework and playing one thing i would love to see in here is an option where you can have multiple characters so a parent can get the app on their phone and make a character for each child so that they can keep track of what their child has done and what rewards they can have ex playing games extra dessert screen time etc,5,2020-09-07 04:04:32,6,"Thanks for the feedback.

i have only had it for a few days and don t fully understand every feature but it is the only to do list app that has so far worked for me probably because of it being based on a reward system even if the rewards are only virtual,5,2020-08-18 22:21:09,0,Thanks for the feedback.

love the app but i have a question i have a morning routine set up with subtasks is there a way to hide the subtasks from my daily task veiw and only have them show under the master task pulldown tab also i would love it if i could order my tasks customly without having to assign a time to them this is by far the best app i have found for setting to do s for yourself as an adult with adhd i love the fun childish functionality without it looking like a childs game on my phone,5,2020-08-11 06:52:16,0,"Thanks for the encouraging feedback. Looks like you have ""Show subtasks in task lists"" option enabled in app settings, just disable it and subtasks will be shown only under parent tasks. As for manual reorder, unfortunately it's not technically feasible due to current implementation of tasks and groups."

i love the app and it s customizablity with some notes repeats are confusing and not easy to work about for instance repeat times during one day versus general repeats moving tasks to different days calendar drag can set specific times on multiple reminders making routines changes easy to lose when pressing back and unable to manually order tasks by preference in list form adding stars for great responsiveness and care of creator d,5,2020-08-10 14:45:11,15,Really appreciate your feedback and suggestion.

everything is able to be modified you can gamify whatever you want of your day a day life it would be nice to sort tasks as you wish just moving them in the order you want without needing to rename them or other tricks to put them in the order you like however still being quite good for everything it offers,5,2020-08-03 15:54:23,1,"Unfortunately manual tasks reordering is almost impossible to implement at the moment due to technical limitations. However, thanks for you encouraging words!"
hi i just started using this app a few days ago and i m absolutely blown away it s kept me on track for a bunch of my activities and the ui is so customisable while being clean i have a minor suggestion about if progress bars to recurrent activities can be added eg i m reading a book and have that as a recurring task but i d like a slide bar to be able to advance my progress daily subtasks don t show in the widget as well this app is still amazing and great work on everything so far,5,2020-08-02 18:58:22,34,"Thanks for the feedback! Interesting idea on progress, not sure though how it can be added to be as flexible as possible. I have some thoughts on new type of task - accumulative, where you could set units of executions (pages of book), max number of units, reward per unit and reward per whole execution. But that's just an idea yet :)"
the best app you can find of this kind it is well built creative and regularly updated with this app you don t need any other planning or to do list apps it is completely worth buying i gladly payed full price for this high quality app,5,2020-08-01 23:17:22,0,Thanks for such great review and especially for your support!

this is the best most customizable app around i appreciate the dev for being on top of responding to feedback and such the app has grown over the years and it keeps getting better and better with quality of life changes it s actually spoiled me from installing other similar style apps again simply because i can just make everything to my taste all in one app it really makes keeping a schedule feel like less of a chore and for a gamer like me that s golden real life questing is fun,5,2020-07-31 09:45:10,21,"Wow, that's greatest review ever! Thanks, it encourages me to work on app even more!"

such a good idea very generous to help us out for free helps me recognize my accomplishments instead of dismissing them and losing track of how much progress i m making would recommend having essential daily tasks pre scheduled so that they re easy to tick off the list but writing in unique events only after they ve been accomplished in order to maintain intrinsic motivation memory and your capacity to self monitor use this to record progress not replace internal self determination,5,2020-07-25 17:18:33,10,Thank you for such great feedback!
only complaint is how often it asks you to rate it other than that the app is even so great imo that it s work buying the subscription i love how customizable it is for sure one of my top 5 favorite apps,5,2020-07-25 03:18:29,0,"Thanks for the feedback. I've reduced frequency of rate popups, it should be better starting from next update. Meanwhile you can just click on any rating, it's initial rating mostly and it won't be shown after first rate."

i love this app i had tried habit rpg and i liked the generalized idea behind it but wished it was more in depth video game like that you could not only lvl up but gain skill points this is extremely detailed even has characteristics you can lvl up as well as skills allows for complete customization in everything being a nerd someone who lacks discipline i forsee this to be an extremely useful tool to help me stay on task achieve my goals and feel like i am actually lvling up irl,5,2020-07-12 08:08:58,1,Thank you for such great and encouraging review!
it really feels like i have a tabletop character sheet for myself and i didn t even know i wanted it until now the skill and stat customization is incredibly deep the reward system is great i highly recommend the premium if you can afford it these devs deserve it and the calendar is a nice bonus on top of all the aesthetic additions,5,2020-07-12 01:19:11,4,Thank you so much for your great review!
beautiful and detailed app there are two features that would make it more useful 1 a counter to keep track of quantity example alcohol drinks 2 a limit which causes a fail if you go over example limit 14 drinks in a week or 2 per day,5,2020-07-11 22:24:13,0,"Thanks for the feedback. I can suggest yoiu to take a look at inventory section of the app. It could help you to limit usage of items, e.g. you can purchase 14 ""Alcohol drinks"" at the beginning of the week and consume it one by one. If no such items left - drink shouldn't be consumed in real life."
this is cool i m on my first day and just put in all my major daily goals like exercising and reading you can customize the traits that are rewarded by each activity as well as penalties for failure you can even link customizable titles to your level progression my personal goal archwizard of the order of ptolemy very few features are locked behind the paywall and everything that is essential is free,5,2020-07-11 20:19:50,6,Thank you so much for your review!

it s a really great app i love most that it reminds you about your tasks since i tend to forget a lot especially feeding my pets and watering my plants it s easy and fun to use especially with the reward system i think it would be challenging if the app had personal rewards for say keeping up with your tasks for a large period of time and all but honestly i love the app it s perfect you can personalize it to whatever you want or need,5,2020-07-02 23:51:36,2,Thank you so much for your review!

awesome app to gamify tasks i ve been using it for 3 months and i love many things about it i won t write them because i can only type 500 characters but i wish it could include time tracking like the one from toggl also i strongly wish it could have a desktop version and ios another thing would be to sincronize with a google calendar not only the one inside the app i also think the calendar needs accuracy lastly being able to interact with other users and a ranking would be great,5,2020-06-30 01:25:50,28,Thanks for the great review and a lot of suggestion.

life changing app for someone who loves rpg game so much like me making myself the avatar in real life helps much to change my own attitude to work and lifestyle my only comment is to allow description for every hero statuses and maybe in the future the icon will look more appealing with colors also for premium members let them be able to have several heroes at once this will inspire people to work on different aspect of their life more closely thank you for makin such an amazing app,5,2020-06-08 21:18:48,4,"Thanks for the great feedback!
Hm, could you please me some example of status with description? Idea seems nice.
Good thought with icons. By the way, for hero avatar you can set your own icon.
I've thought about multiple heroes, but it's an overkill from development perspective."
great app could suggest rewards that fit the task type offer actual customer icon customization and allow linkage of tasks to overarching goals that have separate rewards attached other than that best app like this i can find a lot of great features,5,2020-06-08 04:19:56,1,Thanks for the feedback and for the suggestions!

this is an amazing app you re able to customize almost everything to what you want there are some things i d love to see added though some way to have an item reward you with money would be nice and being able to have a task directly award you with an item too developer s if you see this you have done an amazing job i ll be getting the in app subscription soon to support you,5,2020-06-07 11:44:40,16,"Thanks for the great feedback!
Starting from the recent update you can add inventory items as reward for task execution. Just edit the task :)
As for item which can give money reward - it's a bit complicated and I'm not really sure that it would be useful in the app."

overall very good u can edit the skills and characteristics u want and edit the rewards as well i just want to suggest can u add a feature where we could interact with other users or create a group according to the skills and characteristics that we have in that way we can also get rewards for our grp and loose our stamina health if we wont be able to do task these will trigger us more to participate ill purchase the calendar soon if school will be back thanks,5,2020-05-31 09:57:47,12,"Thanks for the feedback and great suggestion.
I'm planning to work on more social features in future. My nearest goal will be to add possibility to create tasks which are shared between users."
first of all it s an excellent app i like the fact that it is highly customizable however i d like to make a suggestion your app lacks the emotional aspect a bit i suggest to add support of small custom avatar like images to the tasks instead of monotone colored icons this way a task will associate with something positive inspirational pressing on a task could then show a larger version of the image in the task view screen do not understimate the power of visual associations,5,2020-05-30 20:32:00,37,"Thanks for the great feedback.
It's pretty hard to add icons that will suite to all users. I suppose I'll do it in a different way.
I'm planning to add possibility to set custom icons for tasks (and other items) in future. Basically users will be able to select any icon from their device and use it as task icon."

There are 2 ways to fail task.
1. Long press task and select Fail option in appeared menu.

if you see this taras or other developers i believe your app would benefit immensely and more people will download it if you were to implement an online feature or a way to access on any device such as a computer if you would upload a website with this apps interface and sync to the cloud more people would be able to access it meaning more profit which would mean more great reviews etc if you were to add this feature like habitica has i and more people will likely buy the subscription,5,2020-05-15 02:20:33,17,"Thanks for the review.
Yes, that's a great idea, but Do It Now is ind of hobby project and there's only one person behind the whole project.

рекомендую отличное приложение я вернулся и снова сразу подписался реквест из за большого количества опций и настроек часто тратишь много времени на заполнения всей инфы о задачах я бы очень хотел увидеть возможность добавления стандартных параметров для пользовательских групп задач к примеру у меня есть to do лист и скажем книги хотелось бы чтобы при добавлении задач на прямую в группу подтягивалась иконка с цветом длительность повторение и др параметры и побольше иконок для платной,5,2020-05-12 18:35:24,0,"Спасибо за отзыв.
Хорошая идея, очень затратная по времени реализации, но мне нравится. Добавлю в список планов.

firstly thanks for your quick responses back i appreciate it ok so can you explain how to do it and where that is on the app because there s no tutorial for that part when i click on the other tabs that show the month stats and graph there s nothing indicating that the old schedule has been saved in an independent track and a new track created,3,2020-02-29 12:20:32,3,"Hi TS: That feature will allow to edit the schedule, but keeping the statistics for your old data.

i like this app and i bought premium even it was a little expensive 5 49 euro what i don t like is habits with a numeric value don t allow at least 0 times a day if you want to do something 6 times a week with the possibility to do it twice on one day it will stay undone the other days 1 tasks habits which are marked as undone may be send to the bottom too 1 whitout premium you only can scedule up to 7 habits after a removal of any named defect i will change my rating,3,2020-02-11 03:11:38,4,Hi. We work hard to make HabitNow a good app everyday. We have a private support channel continuously taking suggestions from the users. 1 star reviews are really harmfull for a brand new app like this and can affect a lot its overall rating and so its future development. It would be of great help if your rating reflects the positive aspects too.
i like this app it s simple and gets the job done only downside is you re allowed to track up to only seven habits without the premium version,3,2020-02-08 12:53:54,2,
my personal experience with the app makes me say this is deforme designed more as a task management app than a habit tracking app the two things i want to do when building a new habit are 1 easily enter the stats for the habits i m tracking and 2 see the timeline of the habit growth in a snapshot or as a dashboard this app focuses on today s tasks so getting to the specific habits entering information for another day and charting progress are too cumbersome,3,2020-01-25 20:20:21,0,"Hi: The app was designed as a habit tracker. After some time of development, we found useful to add the to-do list feature. There are plenty of habit trackers out there but none of them integrates the concept of daily routine. We think the statistics that the app provides are more than enough to allow te correct tracking of any habit. Greetings!"
setting habits was not simple enough and at the same time was missing options it kept telling me to choose a number i would press next and same error,3,2020-01-18 11:41:52,19,
i can t arrange my habits in the order i want i have to choose from preselected options like alphabetical,3,2020-01-07 12:37:12,36,Most users have lists with many items. We decided to add the predefined order options so that users do not have the need to sort their tasks all the time. Just imagine ordering 20 tasks every day. You can use the priority option to show the most important activities at the beginning! Greetings
i did like the app after i m reinstalling the app what happens to my in app purchase i had purchased the app rt now which i m using is it the paid one or free one do i need to pay for premium again,3,2019-12-22 18:21:57,0,"Ryan: Thank you for replying!

unable to edit the day you want to do your habit unless i delete and recreate the habit which means i would lose my past statistics,3,2019-12-15 03:57:14,5,We are working on that. Keeping the statistics imply some complex calculations. We will release an update on next week with a new multi track option for habits. Regards.
it has almost everything that i need but the thing that frustrates me the most is the calendar view that s really the most important thing to see how many days you ve tracked in a row switch to calendar view it looks just like a regular calendar and nothing is highlighted for anything you have to click on each individual day to see what it looks like,3,2019-12-01 20:26:38,6,The calendar IS a regular calendar. That is its function. A calendar. You can touch on a day and see it's schedule. The apps has many options and also has a calendar. You can navigate between days touching on the arrows on top. Regards

this app works nice if you want to track daily or weekly tasks but it was impossible for me to schedule tasks that should happen at a certain interval for example every two weeks or every 5th of the month there is the option to schedule a task a certain amount of times per month but not to set specific intervals or dates for such occurrences this was unfortunately a dealbreaker,3,2019-10-26 14:11:59,9,
two requests please 1 allow the user to set what time the day recurrent tasks reset not everyone s day ends at midnight 2 propagate the theme selected to the widget if i have selected a dark blue theme my widget should have the same dark blue icon s not a bright red habitnow one good so far more customization would make it great thanks,3,2019-10-14 04:57:05,1,"Hi Michael: Icons are images, and adding icons for each color theme would mean adding too much extra size to the application.

it s very useful so far however i m not sure if you can change your daily routine i made one for monday and it auto filled for every single day of the week whereas i need them different and when i go to try and add a new task to my day that i want it changes it for all of them disappointing and useless if theres no way to bypass that might as well go back to pen and paper,3,2019-10-10 19:19:02,3,Hi Korinne.

ui needs major improvements the only app i believe which give quantitative habits also not just binary like 4 pages to read statistics based on that can be improved but nevertheless kudos for the idea this is only app which gives upto 7 habits in free version so keeping it else due to ui would have rejected long time back current apps in market give 3 or 5 max,3,2019-09-08 13:20:12,3,You can send your design ideas to habitnow.apps@gmail.com

It is difficult to add a functionality like that to a complex app like this because a physical limitation of tap events.

tasks cannot be ordered by their time a habit not done is not shown as overdue edit i checked again to use it but 1 recurring task cannot be created 2 habits are shown like scheduled tasks it s motivating to see habit progress instead on landing screen 3 it s more useful to see progress on habit activity instead of successful day if we set to do 2 times a day but we could do it only once it should show progress for a 30 day goal as 1 2 today 1 60 total instead of 0 30 or 1 30,3,2019-08-21 14:08:37,1,"Hi Sukhvinder, we just added the option to sort habits and tasks by their time of the day.

decent simple just a bit too simple for me i thought the percentages counted for task progress s though it were a whole project unfortunately it seems to only relate to habits i d like to see subtasks and then percentage competed at least the habit statistics are clear and aesthetically pleasing,3,2019-08-18 21:51:24,0,

absolutely amazing to be able to track both daily habits as well as tasks in the same app only thing that would make this the best choice for this purpose is to have a web application to at least be able to add new habits or tasks and mark them as completed was previously using todoist for this purpose and just switched to habitnow some other useful features add a length to a task or habit be able to set a time so that tasks and daily habits can be sorted by time of day,4,2020-07-25 23:51:52,16,

i got this app to setup a schedule to work from home and it s been good for that i just set up a bunch of habits at the right time each day the widget has been handy too to keep my schedule on my home screen the app could do to look a bit more modern but all of my reminders come exactly 3 minutes late every notification for a habit comes exactly 3 minutes late i e reminder set to 2 00pm notification arrives at 2 03pm etc developers,4,2020-07-08 11:41:33,6,Hi Gabriel: Check your Samsung battery optimization options.

good application one of the best habit tracker applications available on play store should have more features like authentication by fingerprint scanner cloud storage easily accessible sticky notes daily the notes option in daily habit calendar can be improved perhaps adding a separate tab to view daily added notes would be a great idea i would have definitely bought premium if it had cloud auto storage better functionality for keeping notes and fingerprint authentication,4,2020-06-30 14:36:38,6,
dashboard charts better be inclusive all habits not just per one habit also download to excel would be nice,4,2020-06-23 00:26:30,0,
helpful but needs a way to quickly customize the order of the goals currently the choices are alphabetical by priority etc but i would prefer a click and drag option to have them show up in the widget in the specific other i would like i had to go into each goal and add a specific time to each one too get them in the order i want even though i don t want to do them at a specific time,4,2020-06-18 16:57:35,66,

really a fabulous app i have tried several of the habit tracking apps this is by far one of my favourite as it combines daily habit tasks with some ad hoc tasks for day to day life only one feature i miss in this app is the ability to select the snooze time ex whether i want to snooze for 1 hour or 1 day etc atleast some standard options currently it gives only 1 option apart from that it s the best app,4,2020-06-13 02:23:43,4,
straight forward i like the widgets on this and makes it easy to check in on what you need to do for the day the scheduling is also very helpful because you can have tasks that are intermittent or habits that are intermittent on a regular schedule it s also nice to be able to have a goal as a number or just a yes or no did you do it or not and the statistics are nice because you can look back and see how consistent you ve been with something and that will remind you to buckle down,4,2020-06-12 18:17:31,18,
hi i would ve given this app 5 5 if i hadn t already spent so much time exploring it it s so cumbersome as it is to check what i have scheduled for a day in the future i have to enter the calendar and click on the date on a month view interface please make it more intuitive let me swipe in a direction to navigate to the past future let me also edit tasks habits from a day in the future,4,2020-06-11 18:14:14,8,
i wish this app allowed me to adjust what habit i want in any order i want it lets me organize my abc order or time but not the way i need it also wish the conpleted habit or task would disaapear after i complete each day it either stays where it is or goes to bottom other than these i like it,4,2020-06-10 22:55:43,1,"Thank you for your feedback Novelle, we'll work on that!"
great app with an ugly widget if the widget was cleaner i d give 5 stars,4,2020-06-09 02:42:18,0,
almost perfect an option to export archived habits preferably to excel would be great,4,2020-06-07 11:50:41,0,

love this,4,2020-05-28 02:06:15,0,
decent app with good features allowing for good habbit tracking but i am unable to reschedule dates on the habits i have to delete the habit then remake it with the revised dates which is a big hassle,4,2020-05-27 13:56:49,0,
very good simple and easy to use i would like to see more statistics because for now i can only see the statistics for only one habit at a time but not a overall statistics,4,2020-05-26 23:48:59,0,
easy to use and the alarm works great,4,2020-05-26 20:40:53,0,
addition of day counter for negative habits will be great also any option for writing notes for failures in habits will be useful and widget isn t working,4,2020-05-23 11:45:13,0,
what if one wants to add a habit wherein one wants to do that thing 4 times in a week and not on 4 specific days of the week i guess while adding a habit this app requires one to select 4 specific days just a suggestion it would be really great if this flexibility can be allowed,4,2020-05-17 11:43:53,0,"Hi KM: You can create habits with ""some times per period"" frequency. It can be per month or week. Thank you for contacting us. If you need help from our support contact us to habitnow.apps@gmail.com and we will be glad to help!"
i love it only problem i found is that you can t edit the start date once the habit is created which is a nuisance,4,2020-05-13 23:34:21,0,Hi Ian: We are working in an update to solve this inconvenience. Thank you for your feedback!
have only used the app a little while not to bad for basic tasks to bad you can t do lots of tasks unless you buy the premium version it s an easy app to use,4,2020-05-13 03:24:27,2,
everything is good i bought the premium after 5 minutes used but one question why we can t create a task with a date which is the day before eg today is 11 may i can t create a task on date 10 may sometimes we might be overlooked or too busy to add task but we need to have a record of what we had done on the day it can make us feel so completed,4,2020-05-11 07:00:12,35,
i like this app as it is a simple way of tracking your habits however there are a couple of things i wish were improved 1 if i have updated all of my habits for the day the app should know that and stop the daily reminder to complete them 2 i wish the analysis was a little better have some graphs visually showing progress also how about showing how i am doing on my habits as a whole not just the individuals for example if i have a day where i don t do any of my habits thx,4,2020-05-10 15:30:01,51,
have been using it for a week only and will most likely go premium i love it but a few needed suggestions an option to make a task recurring and also maybe on one same habit have different times per day weekday weekend and i can t seem to edit which days for habits after the initial setup i also would like the completed button to be a little bit harder do maybe a swipe would be nicer,4,2020-05-09 20:35:29,39,"Hi Cinthia: We programed habits as recurring tasks.

the app is perfect for people trying to get more organized it s easy to use and i use it all the time for homework or workouts the only tiny problem is that it has some locked features that u have to pay for,4,2020-04-21 20:03:07,0,

it s good but calendar view just don t make sense with the obligation to select a day to see it s schedule which is not what i d be looking for when in calendar view preferring much more to see in one look any day i haven t done something or something like rate of habits successfully done,4,2020-04-17 22:10:01,0,Hi Romulo: We will work on that.

preaty nice but they could improuve the ui it took me some time to figure it out and i know that to use the widgets on the home screen you need to pay for premium but it would be an improvement if it would instead take you to the app,4,2020-04-17 11:38:01,0,"Hi Rick: Thank you for your feedback.

hesitant to buy premium i feel like currently the only reason to buy premium is to have more than 7 habits and to make it look pretty i m on a budget and if i m spending 5 i certainly want more bang for my buck i wish the developers offered more in premium to make it worth the price,4,2020-04-16 07:13:20,7,Hi Ashley: We are working on more functionalities for both premium and no premium users! Thank you for your feedback!
i find the app amazing it is one of the best habit apps that i ve used the only thing i don t like is that i ve bought the premium but i don t feel like it was worth it the only thing that i really needed was to have more than 7 habits but the rest is just decoration it would be really nice if there is an overall progress page to check how am i doing in every habit instead of going through every single one of them another thing that would do this app just perfect would be the possibility of having a desktop app for the computer other than that i recommend to download it keep doing it so,4,2020-04-09 19:55:35,14,
great app very usable and straightforward but i wish the calendar view showed the days you had completed all of your goals for that day seeing your progress streak would be very encouraging,4,2020-04-06 12:45:45,0,
wish you could set tasks to recur at regular times but it s a good app overall,4,2020-04-03 04:59:58,0,
it is a great app but still there is space for some improvement the calendar for example you have one to add more tasks other to see each specific task and the days that you did the job but note one to see the sum of all tasks you should create a resume calendar where i can see the percentage of jobs that i accomplished in each day,4,2020-04-03 04:43:39,38,
easy simple cheerful effective,4,2020-04-01 18:43:23,0,
funciona bien pero si le hacen falta cosas tengo la versión premium resulta que debería existir la opción de crear categorías donde uno pueda seleccionar el ícono que más le convenga de la lista que ustedes dejen y poder asignarle el nombre de la categoría por ejemplo como sabemos existe categoría denominada study pero no se puede configurar mas de ahí sería bueno poder crear categorías con el nombre de cada materia para tener un mejor control de lo que se hace,4,2020-04-01 09:23:32,0,"Hola Daniel: Estamos trabajando para añadir nuevas funcionalidades a la app. Tenemos planeado agregar categorías personalizadas pronto!

habitnow is the first todo list with a key feature i ve been looking for to do items that are automatically created at certain times as such it is the best such app i ve ever used the only problem is that the author made no provision for hiding completed items they just hang around cluttering the list the best it does is move them to the bottom i find it very odd that anyone would want to stare at completed to do items certainly that shouldn t be the default but there it is,4,2020-03-18 06:40:51,22,

love the app best of it s kind imo not perfect but so close this app has the potential to be used for so much more than just habits and tasks if i may suggest having the 00 digits be optional and not by default when setting entering goals having multiple reminder notification throughout the day on one habit to enter data multiple times a day ex 200 push ups a day with 4 reminders so i can do 4x50 or something instead of having 4 habits or the ability to group habits,4,2020-03-09 18:17:26,9,"Thank you for your feedback Jean-Christophe, we will work on that!"

não tem a opçāo de sub tarefa,4,2020-03-07 08:14:12,0,
i have been using this premium version of app from past 6 months and its really great but i still believe there are few feature still missing in it to make things easy like there should be dashboard which gives details of all habbits progress in bar percentage marked successful currently you have to go to each habbit and check the status so a centralized section giving more details on the progress would be helpful like it is in habbit tracker app also a dynamic habbit counter could be added,4,2020-03-05 08:55:48,4,
nice but please give option to add different time intervals for habits for example i want to develop habit of drinking water and want the reminder to come at multiple particular times a day the app allows only one specific time for the reminder so please add the mentioned feature,4,2020-03-04 01:49:41,0,
i haven t started using it officially but i m giving a 4 star because the user interface is on point i m starting my habits on monday hopefully the functionality part will be as user friendly as the ui thank you,4,2020-02-22 18:31:08,0,
i looked at a lot of habit tracking apps and this one was the closest i ve found to what i was looking for unless i missed how where to do them there are three things i wish i could do in the app first create custom categories subcategories especially under health second edit start dates without having to delete and retype to correct three have the ability to add notes,4,2020-02-10 21:34:04,9,"Hi Lee: To add a note, long tap on any habit entry in the to-do list or any habit calendar. We are working on a multi-track feature to add more that one schedule for a habit. After that, we will start to work on categories edition and online backups. Thank you for your review!"
so far i like the app question i see a spot where it says notes for the month but how do i input notes i don t see the option to enter notes,4,2020-02-06 19:44:42,1,Hi Alliance: You can create a note for every day entry of your habits. Just tap on a day in any habit calendar or on a habit entry of the todo list!
hey awesome app it wasn t long until i purchased the unlocked version however some things could be improved for example you can t change units after the habit is created and it would be nice to hide the 0 part after digits since mostly it refers to minutes or iterations or cups and it looks kinda sloppy to see your goal described as learn at least 30 0 minutes or drink at least 2 0 cups if the number is whole why not just hide that point zero it ll look neater i think,4,2020-02-06 05:49:35,31,

would have been a five star had something as simple as a color theme change not came with a price seriously i have to pay premium prices just to go into dark mode if i was going to pay i m most certainly not paying now that s just too petty a thing however great concept guys,4,2020-01-13 06:55:41,1,"Hi LoveAndLight: Thank you for the feedback!

another important feature missing is the ability to tell if i have future tasks scheduled when looking at the calendar currently the calander view shows days in a circle please colorize the background of that circle if there are tasks scheduled on that day this is essential in order to know what days i have future tasks scheduled on on top of the calendar it says to pick a day to see if i have a scheduled task that is not efficient as i would need to go click each day one by one,4,2019-09-13 01:48:16,5,"Hi Edward: That could consume many resources of your phone because it require several calculations for every day showed in the calendar, but we will work on that because we know it could be useful for many users.

this is actually a really good app i just have a couple of suggestions that make things a little more helpful 1 to be able to rearrange the habits or tasks by the time we have it set so it will look like more of a daily schedule instead of just a list 2 a button that goes with when you want to do your habit or task have it be more specific just in case we want to break our task or habit up and do half earlier in the day and the other half like drinking water or studying,4,2019-08-04 09:54:14,32,"Hi Sha'Coya. About your first suggestion: You are able to do it! Open the app settings and select ""By time"" item in the ""To-do list order"" option.
About your second suggestion: You can set a habit with a daily value of ""Exactly 1 in a day"" and set the value of 0.5 earlier and set 1 later!

You can change habit status for previous days from ""My habits"" section, or from the habit calendar, by touching on the day you want to update.
Thanks for your review! We are working to make HabitNow a better app!"

i really like this app so far its flexible ans very customizable the only thing i would add is either more categories the ability to add my own health and home are very broad categories so being able to have sub categories would be nice,4,2019-07-10 00:31:38,6,"Thanks Bri.

almost perfect there s only one feature i d like it to have that it doesn t modify start of the week to europeans it makes absolutely no sense to start the week on a sunday which throws off my quantifications i bought premium but will update my review if this is added edit it worked thanks,5,2020-10-26 11:34:33,0,Thank you for your review Bruno! Actually the app start of the week is given by the OS depending your device language. One quick solution for this is to change your language from English US to English UK since the first day of the week in United Kingdom is Monday. Make us know if that works for you!

i ve never rated something on google play so for this app to get me to give an amazing rating is saying something this is my favorite routine planning app because it allows you to set habits and routines in an intuitive way it allows you to view the progress you re making with habits and it gives you the most functionality without having to pay anything other apps give little functionality before you have to pay,5,2020-07-25 01:50:06,38,

this app is exactly what i was looking for you can have tasks repeat daily weekly monthly every three days every tuesday and thursday etc you can also add one time tasks that will show up every day on your checklist until you complete it this has made my daily life so much easier and keeps me from forgetting to do important things my one suggestion to make the app better would be the ability to drag and drop tasks and habits into a specific order besides that it is great,5,2020-07-04 03:52:06,29,

sharing does not work in any way for basic todo its ok sharing its absolute trash if you share a list with somebody and that somebody addicts and item or creates an item you don t see any changes the person that you share a list with only sees an initial review of your list however no changes are propagated between the owner and sharing destination and what is even worse is if the sharing destination user updates any tasks that task disappear from the to do list that means items disappear,1,2020-10-14 09:18:25,3,
wunderlist was a wonderful piece of software that initially continued to work well after being acquired by microsoft the conversion to todo was ok some lost features but initially seemed ok the android and desktop app no longer consistently sync and lately the app consistently loses my repeating tasks they simply disappear upon completion completed recurring tasks still display on my day and recurring tasks also lately weirdly create duplicate tasks when repeating todo isn t even close to wunderlist unfortunately so time to move on,1,2020-10-14 05:28:27,4,"Hey David,

the daily reminder for any task only works if the task is tapped completed either through notification completed snooze or through app even if the task is actually not completed if you swipe the notification without tapping on completed the daily reminder stops this is funny the daily reminder should continue daily whether the task for a particular day is completed or not completed,1,2020-10-11 18:30:57,21,"Hello Javed,

granted i just downloaded the app but i have yet to find anything useful about it copy pasting in and then reorganizing a basic task list took me about a half hour seriously no drag and drop and i haven t been able to figure out how to share a task list with someone else if i can t share the task list why is there an assigned to me toggle instructions on the ms website seem to be referencing a completely different version than the one i have utterly useless and frustrating,1,2020-10-10 03:25:55,44,
almost perfect if you could make option so tasks tabs can be little smaller that is more compact it would be perfect app it would save screen space and fit more tabs on screen,1,2020-10-09 03:20:50,1,
all tasks now appear with a note icon even if there is no note there completely unreliable with the reminders of repeated tasks sometimes the remind me at goes blank for no apparent reason check the task after midnight of its due date and you won t get reminded of this task the next day the app either forgets remind me or repeat part after one cycle of task done,1,2020-10-08 14:17:32,21,

terrible i m sure i m not the only one saying this but i ll add mine it used to be a great app as wunderlist but is now terrible i can only assume its intentional to force people elsewhere because there s some money to be made an added recent quirk is it doubling any hylerlink in the notes whenever you close the keyboard a more insane quirk i couldn t dream up don t bother,1,2020-10-05 11:46:50,6,
updated i used to have this rated 4 stars until the most recent update which has issues with website addresses now every time you go into a note with a web address it doubles it each time you write anything and exit previous 4 star review i was an hugh supporter of listmaster but they went out of business this app does even more except i would like to see some type of an import export feature using csv files for file backup,1,2020-10-05 05:02:12,1,

anybody who selected 5 starts clearly did not ever use wunderlist but it is impossible not to make the comparison consideration for a review this company plays foul you buy out an excellent competitor for this app you are pushing and then rather than improve on it you produce something unquestionably inferior dastardly deed and regardless of your improvements there are others out there i ll choose you won t get my support full stop 1 i can t add a task and have it emailed to the team member they have to keep checking todo all during the day wasting time 2 we lost the crucial comments section this allowed a team member to provide a status update or send a query this had a date and time stamp which gave a history that helped to determine the pace of work on the task it allowed the team leader to communicate easily and give feedback now we have to go to a different app like email or whatsapp to respond 3 can t sort the tasks according to team member so i gotta scroll and scroll to find all tasks i gotta talk to a team member about there s more but out of words,1,2020-09-29 22:32:32,2,

why on earth would you create an app that doesn t link with your calendar the to do app is straightforward on android app and desktop version however there s no way to link it to microsoft 365 calendar it s within the same suite of microsoft 365 and yet you can t schedule on either one to show up on the other that s asinine you would think this would be a primary feature but the product manager must be sleep at the wheel it s mystifying,1,2020-07-17 06:03:08,3,

everything is three colors black white and bg color nothing feels separate or distinct meaning i find it hard to visually separate individual tasks to do lists should help me break down tasks not make them feel like a uniform lump the star shouldn t be the same color as the background if it s supposed to stand out please make the star stand out more with a banner like wunderlist and with a different color,2,2020-05-14 21:25:50,3,
really miss wunderlist this just feels like a list of work i have to do rather than a list of possibilities from which to choose to do is a clunky pc type office app wunderlist was a fun life mobile app i ll be looking for an alternative to to do,2,2020-05-14 20:53:07,0,
it was great until the latest release broke most of the useful functionality,2,2020-05-14 18:33:51,0,
i switched over to microsoft to do after being notified that wunderlist would not be available with the most recent update to the app the planned list now only shows a filtered view and i have to group it by date to even see it for each day previously i could see everything at once by due date even overdue items i can appreciate that everyone might not want to see everything there should be an all option if you are going to limit this looks like i get to find a new app,2,2020-05-14 17:55:42,65,
also forced to move from wunderlist im missing the part on my widget where i could see today s tasks but also those for my week and the overdue tasks as well please improve,2,2020-05-13 20:46:37,0,

actually wasn t a terrible replacement for wunderlist until the last update the one feature i used all the time was the ability to show completed items with un completed and sort the whole list and then hide completed items again leaving everything sorted now you can no longer merge the lists and sort why take something out that was actually useful now this app is virtually useless for me,2,2020-05-11 08:57:31,1,"We are sorry for the inconvenience and are working on this issue.

the app is good and useful with great features it has everything that you need for a basic to do list app but the reason for my 3 stars is that the widget is broken,3,2020-10-26 21:46:32,1,

o aplicativo é muito bom porém algumas coisas precisam ser melhoradas primeiro deveria ter um opção que você gravasse uma mensagem de voz registrando a tarefa por via de áudio segundo deveria ter uma opção de tarefa não cumprida um x vermelho que indica que a tarefa não foi cumprida porque quando eu registro uma tarefa para ser feita diariamente e algum dia eu não a cumpra não tem a opção de registrá la como não feita e enquanto eu não colocá la como feita o app não põe no dia seguinte,5,2020-10-27 00:12:25,0,

excellent app for setting up ur daily routine,5,2020-10-24 14:11:08,0,
for me the best app for organizing your life but some things should be improved though 1 you can t set monday as the first day of the week 2 having some of your notes appear both in planned and tasks and some in planned but not in tasks is bewildering besides planned and tasks there are two more lists my day and important why so many overlapping lists 3 you can t change fixed time for reminder alarm for example tomorrow is always at 9 a m you can t change that to say 10 a m 4 you can t set quick alarm for example you can t type some note and then tap remind me in half an hour or in 15 minutes in two hours etc there s no such option 5 you can t insert a photo or voice recording into your reminders 6 you can t protect your reminders and notes with a password anyone can read them,5,2020-10-24 11:01:39,34,

i wanted to like it iinitially it looked great but it has such a limited window of time view it s no good for planning a few hours view and that s it scrolling hour by hour day by day useless its sole function appears to be to tell you what you ve got coming up in the next few hours which frankly is not much use to anyone as far as i can see cloud cal uses similar circles with a view of the whole month which would be great but sadly the pro version doesn t work so no go there either,1,2020-02-10 03:16:15,6,"The idea of ​​the application is not just in the circular output of the maximum number of events, but in the intuitive concept of repeating the real 12/24-hour clock.

could not get app to consistently stay connected to my google calendars,2,2018-01-17 07:02:25,0,
i love the idea but there are syncing issues events take forever to show on the graph regardless of whether i entered them in the sectograph app or my google calendar they show up in my google calender almost automatically regardless of the same also i think 12 hour clock makes it tricky to read since the switch from am to pm is in the middle of the day i have something starting at 12 30 and i cant see it on the sectograph but there is a little arrow at that start time with the first letter of that event and nothing else it s confusing,2,2018-01-05 21:32:54,1,

don t like that i can only add items through the calendar i don t put everything on the calendar that s on my todo list,3,2020-08-25 08:56:57,0,
really good idea clearly shows what s coming up in my day and helps me manage my time the one thing that winds me up with it is how it fades into the next clock face i decided to pay for the app to have he 24 hr clock display and i would much prefer if the display changed at midnight rather than partially showing tomorrow and partially showing today it s really confusing to look at and makes it difficult to visualise the day as a whole the lack of this option feels like an oversight,3,2020-08-23 23:14:17,41,
i really really enjoyed the app but i have a few problems first pls make it so we can add daily routines bcs some stuff i have to do daily like take medicine or drink a cup of cold water and it s tiring to have to add this every single day so pls add the daily feature second every time i need to add an event i need to go to the calendar and add it there so i literally have to use another app to be able to use this one pls make it so we can add events from the app directly thank youu,3,2020-08-23 13:10:46,8,

this is actually really useful given the kind of arrangement they chose showing tasks like the arms of a clock so it s really convenient for us to know at what time which tasks are there to complete but the problem is that when there are more than one task at the same time the texts superimpose on each othr and we can t read thm considering they use google calender to set up the tasks i feel like google calender itself its widget is more useful than this but 5 5 for user interface,3,2020-06-30 09:06:05,0,

seemed like a good app but doesn t always show your plans it s linked to my calender and i ve added quite a few things for the month but it only shows on this app once and then disappears next time i look at it,3,2019-10-30 15:25:25,94,
i do not understand how i will add events i tried adding events but it only shows up in my calendar not at the sectograph it seems to be useful but i need to know how to make it work,3,2019-10-24 19:17:41,1,
i m liking it but it seems to have some bugs it s currently 01 13am but the widget and app are still showing yesterday s calendar sectors and event list,3,2019-10-23 05:45:26,1,
just a fancy calender widget sure it looks fancy but it doesn t add any functionality it can t do much else it can t track progress,3,2019-10-15 07:21:33,0,
i love the design and the app in general i would give it 5 stars if it would allow to size the image and the information displayed,3,2019-10-12 00:10:26,1,Hello.  You can resize the home screen widget.  Long press on the widget and drag it to the desired size.
everything good simple and easy to use the best one but you dont get reminder as alarm so that you can actually know the schedule its just give a notification which can be easily ignored by mistake please fix this and link it up with alarm too just like you did with default calendar app,3,2019-10-02 19:42:39,11,
too tricky complicated not immediate maybe isnt what i need i need something more simple,3,2019-09-27 21:14:59,0,
works well until you purchase pro after this all your calendar dates are displayed one day ahead your events on a monday in your calendar are displayed on sunday,3,2019-09-21 13:04:22,2,"Hello,
Pro mode has been around for over a year.  Everything should work stably.  Please send me a couple of screenshots at 27applab@gmail.com"
the time in the center of the widget most of the time does not get updated you have to open the app and then the widget is updated,3,2019-09-20 13:59:07,0,"Hello.

it doesnt seem to be possible to delete a single event in a series so if i want to block off an hour every day for the same thing but then i have to schedule a one off thing during that time i can t just delete one occurence and leave the rest of the future occurences alone i love the app otherwise but this problem is pushing me toward a different app,3,2019-09-12 11:05:05,0,
good app but need improvement,3,2019-09-07 01:54:01,0,
its a nice app liked the design also no option to copy paste same schedule to next day,3,2019-08-27 08:46:27,0,

still trying,3,2019-08-19 08:30:18,0,
got this loved the free version paid 3 99 for pro and still don t have the ability or can t figure out how and there are no instructions to set different calendars on two widgets on my phone i ll be happy to give you 5 stars if you send me a how to also it says there is time tracking does that mean i should be able to do a start stop on something while i m doing an activity,3,2019-08-16 20:35:50,2,"Hello.  
Place the widget on the home screen and click the widget button (in the upper right corner).  After that, in the menu that opens, click ""Select calendars for widget.""  
Tracking, here we are talking about visualizing time periods.  It’s like a general concept and not a concrete function :)"
average features,3,2019-08-15 11:33:15,0,
it s pretty neat i love the how everything pops out on the clock only thing is i tried scheduling things after 12 pm and it wouldn t pop up and i notice it only shows 12 hours at a time if you buy the pro version it comes with the 24 hour feature which i think is totally worth it seeing 24 hour option you can see everything from start to finish and not miss anything,3,2019-07-26 12:26:30,0,"Hello. 
Yes you are right.  It works like a 12-hour clock.  
That is why it displays exactly 12 hours.  24 hours we added much later, at the request of users."
nice but there seems to be no way to hide declined events that makes it much less useful would give 5 5 otherwise,3,2019-07-24 13:38:51,0,
it just opens a calender so i m not sure why i need something between me and my regular calendar app,3,2019-07-24 05:47:10,0,"Hello.  
The application visualizes calendar events in a round shape.  It is intended for this purpose, because  calendars offer only a linear form."
nice app i just cannot work out what these random numbers are within the pieces of the pie 35 30 7 35 30 8 35 30 8 35 it is clearly a countdown of some sort but bears no relevance to anything obvious how can i remove these update to reply thank you but i am seeing 7x this info around the pie and personally it serves little use can this function be disabled,3,2019-07-22 10:10:16,1,Hello.

updated was confused that the event list in the actual app wasn t showing events scheduled for the next few days the widget will only show events in the next 12h the event list in the app also only shows events in the next 12h i think this list should list events for that entire day this means i still depend on other apps for an agenda view,3,2019-07-18 07:32:44,2,"Hello

needed a standalone platform which does not connect to any of my calendars,3,2019-06-27 20:55:43,2,
seems good but i would need admin approval to access my work outlook calendar so it s pretty unusable for me,3,2019-06-23 04:54:08,1,"Hi
The application is powerless here.  This is a feature of your corporate policy.  In this case, you generally have to get administrator permission for any application that receives Outlook events."

added feature synchronizer connect added the note writing feature during the call added a feature synchronized with the mail,3,2019-05-02 02:42:49,0,
i would ve liked to use this app but sadly it doesn t seem to recognize european daylight saving time i ve gone through the settings twice this is a deal breaker i m afraid i would still recommend people try the app however if the live in location where dst is rightfully ignored the main concept is really clever and the widget is beautifully designed,3,2019-04-27 23:21:01,30,
wish i could add events without having anything to do with google calendar,3,2019-04-13 11:51:29,0,
cant get demo to play its probably a great app,3,2019-04-13 03:26:12,0,
looks cool but i do not find it actually helpful unless you write down everything you do every hour every day,3,2019-04-04 05:56:01,2,
sorry i dont get it i have no idea why seeing my schedule on a circle is somehow better than a rectangle what am i missing,3,2019-03-31 23:52:54,0,

can you make this app a separated planner and can make an event without using calendar i really like this app but i want this app as my daily task organizer and my calendar as a big event organizer so it won t jumble up in my calendar,3,2019-03-28 10:59:26,2,"Hi.

hi the range of the nuce coloured sectors does not cover the time interval of my events it had been the best reason why i chose this app to have an easy straightforward overview of my plans why doesn t ut work as it is shown on the pictures,3,2019-03-14 19:10:04,1,
i really have wanted this app to work i d really prefer to see my day filled on a clock in such a way so i even came back to try again however i m having trouble putting tasks in after a certain amount they stop saving i m also struggling to see the clock in a way that makes sense it looks very jumbled best of luck i love the concept,3,2019-03-10 07:08:32,2,
good app but needs to add daily to do list,3,2019-03-04 11:25:36,0,"Hi. 
On the event add / edit page, use the event repeat option (by day of the week). Thus, repeated events will need to be added only 1 time.

i had to pay for the option to change the colours then i had to pay more to customise it further exploitative money grabbing like this ensures i ll never recommend it to anyone else works well though,3,2019-03-02 07:19:13,1,
a little confusing at first but it transfers your calendar and alarms to the app one bad part is it adds everything on your calendar like if you add eat breakfast it ll go on your calendar so that s only a little annoying since my calendar needs to be clear and easy to read but besides that it works well,3,2019-02-25 13:18:58,5,"Hello! You may find it useful to create a separate calendar for your routine. Go to the application, to the page ""My calendars"", click ""+ Add more."" Create calendars for any purpose."
this is a great app but i purchased it to be able to use it with my samsung gear s3 little did i know that i can t use it with my watch bc this app was made to be used with android wear which i found out later my bad so will you be working on making this app compatible with samsung gear that would open your market quite a lot with samsung gear users i ve been using the wearable app with my watch but it doesn t work smoothly at all please work on that if you can thanks,3,2019-02-23 04:08:01,14,"Hi!

if you want something that syncs to your calendar you are in luck it really is beautiful and such a wonderful idea however my 3 star review comes from the fact you can t use it without syncing to your calendar and there by having it affect your calendar i was hoping to use this as an hourly time management tool much like a block system but i can t have it be that and have my calendar be a place for just appointments it makes the actual calendar look too full and messy basically in short can you please add an offline tool as well,3,2018-11-15 22:06:39,0,

love it great time management app one thing i think would be great is if you guys would add a feature where it shows like a chart of all your time from the past say like past year so you can see where you are spending your time cumulatively instead of just the chart of how you spend your time each day which is still super helpful but adding a chart of how you spent your time in the past would be great would love to see that feature perhaps on an update of the app,4,2020-10-21 20:23:41,12,
how do i see all events and other day events instead of only today within 12h only is this what you mean by 24h clock in pro will it also show other days with pro i like the app but some things ar not very clear to me thanks,4,2020-10-21 00:57:43,0,
great app love the layout,4,2020-10-17 23:30:05,0,
epic but when i go to a later date like my future birthday 21st may 2021 and i touch the hand of the clock to slide it it takes me back to 21st of may 2020 why does this happen,4,2020-10-17 20:30:48,0,
the clock face schedule calendar i was looking for however since last update clicking on event on the widget doesn t enlarge the event so i couldn t see details unless i open it in the calendar,4,2020-10-17 04:54:17,0,
i don t usually do reviews but this app is honestly quite great it really helps to plan my day visually and the widget helps a ton when i open to my home screen my only complaint is that it does end up crowding my calendar app because it requires you to add an event to the calendar but past that it s pretty great most planner apps don t work but this blew it out of the park,4,2020-10-10 23:28:43,5,

i really liked the concept of the diagram as that s exactly what i was looking for the only drawback for me is that it takes the events from the settings android calendar which is not what i wanted i would prefer to set events in the app straightaway i will download it again if this feature becomes available in the future,4,2020-10-04 19:22:11,7,
i bought the pro version it s a really great app simple clock widget to display all my plans for the day i used it on my smart watch n it s really useful i don t know if it s a bug or not but when i touch the event on the phone widget and it shows the detail after that when i touch the x button it wont go back to the clock face but open the calendar instead and i can t move the watch hands around to see the othe upcoming events i hope there ll be update about these thanks alot,4,2020-10-04 17:08:07,20,
very nice app any chance tasks and reminders can be integrated into the display as well,4,2020-10-04 14:03:21,0,
extremely helpful for a visual thinker like me but the pallette settings are confusing and should be the same for all watch faces having different colors in the app and in the widget and on the watch face is distracting and confusing,4,2020-10-01 21:06:13,0,
works for me so far like it,4,2020-10-01 01:00:47,0,
it s really great app and per partner for day to day life i m giving only 4 star because while selecting any sector time some time it shows different option or sometime it shows correct option but giving another time sector information,4,2020-09-24 05:45:27,2,
not very easy to navigate the settings,4,2020-09-22 18:10:18,0,
love this app i have always thought of time on a clock face and this just makes so much more sense to me than the list of things you get in google calendar and other organisational apps my only suggestion for improvement would be more colour customisation of the segment events and the option to link a segment to a checklist i have found a way to do this but it means i need to use a url link to redirect it to said list and that takes an extra click and is a bit fiddly to set up,4,2020-09-18 14:09:42,13,

there is a delay in updating but apart from that a fine app,4,2020-09-02 16:21:48,0,
i ve always viewed time as a spiral so this fits perfect to keep me visually organized the app is very clever fading out old events while revealing new ones for the next time around the face everything is customizable allowing you to make it look exactly like you need it the only thing i want that would bump this to 5 stars is in app alarms i don t like relying on the calendar s little one time beeps allowing me to set an actual alarm i have to silence would be great,4,2020-09-01 20:45:07,21,

1 add feature to copy created event to add them further in the schedule repeatedly without hassle manually entering each event must end it s a waste of time 2 a feature such that just by rotating the dial of the watch by finger we can make next event in the schedule eg we select duration we click on okay and then we add title to the event to create there task 3 an option to switch between weather we want new start time for the event or just continue with finish time of the last event,4,2020-08-18 07:43:49,11,
you asked me if i would recommend it it s a cool app i like the simplicity of my other calendar a little better i know of another cool device i call it a lev drive interested yes it s just theory for now,4,2020-08-17 07:27:14,0,

good but confusing for new user,4,2020-08-13 22:01:23,0,The app does not add events to the calendar via synchronization.  The application receives them from the calendar and displays them on the watch face.  All events you entered into your calendar - directly

i ve been using the app for quite a while and it seems to work well with google calendar showing my events for the day as claimed by the devs while i have not experienced any issues and the widget is a must have on my home screen customisation options are very limited for free users that s not a big deal but i do wish we had at least a bit more,4,2020-08-01 17:38:48,1,

i am using the paid version and this is really good love it quick question i want to integrate this with the samsung smart watch is this possible otherwise deserves 5 stars please add option to integrate more than 1 outlook email calender account and also themed design faces we can choose from for us who are bad at colors,4,2020-07-21 14:04:47,36,"Hi, There is currently no support for samsung watches, but we will.  As a temporary solution, you can use the ""Wearable Widgets"" app.  And thanks for your suggestions.  Some of this is coming soon."
interesting alternative to combined calendars and notes very visual approach that allows to focus on what matters time is a scarce and unvaluable commodity let s manage it as it should,4,2020-07-21 13:01:39,3,
like the latest updates thanks,4,2020-07-20 23:23:26,1,"Hello,
Are there events for the next 12 hours?  If not, the dial will be empty.  + Go to the ""My calendars"" menu, make sure that the calendars you need are selected"
an excellent time keeping tool would it be possible to have a separate 12 hour widget and another 24 hour widget and it seems that the manual update button in the home screen widget is not working for microsoft outlook,4,2020-07-20 15:07:26,7,"Hi, 
Yes, it is possible"
if alarm connected will be the best one,4,2020-07-15 21:29:28,1,

The device kills the background process of the widget.  Check the resolution for the background operation of the application on the ""application information"" page and the energy saving options on the ""Battery"" settings page in the system.
You can find a solution for your device on this site https://dontkillmyapp.com/"
i used to have this as my default watch face but lately i can t put this on my android wear device maybe my ticwatch is too old for the latest version but it used to be the best does anyone know how to put this watchface on their android wear if it doesn t show up automatically,4,2020-07-13 04:00:34,1,

very close to being 5 stars there are just a few oddities in the user interface and possibly slight inconsistencies on what the app is doing who means that for some the word buggy might be applied i m more inclined to say unpolished in certain areas but a great app none the less,4,2020-07-09 14:29:11,0,
it s ok but i can t put the clock onto my home screen,4,2020-07-06 17:20:06,0,

very nice app but 1 reminders are not showing in the app 2 all day events start from 12 in the app which makes them less readable when there are many all day events so better make it customizable,4,2020-07-04 15:38:16,0,

i love this app but sadly it does not work with active 2 watch imagine the possibilities if you could have this widget on a wearable,4,2020-06-29 09:12:42,1,
one of the best productivity apps on the play store i had recently purchased the app to customize the widget and colors but find it difficult because it could not load the existing wallpaper i am using on the preview it is also hard to try and mix different colors to see it would be best to have the customization be seen real time rather than pick and see color thank you,4,2020-06-28 17:50:33,1,
great app detailed yet concise with only the information i need amazingly it is packaged together with one app so effectively,4,2020-06-25 23:48:31,1,
it s really a good app but they need to add some more features to it like copy schedule and some other good features,4,2020-06-23 08:50:03,0,

this is seriously good and so far it has worked flawlessly just that sometimes it takes a bit of time to update the calendar entry on the app but i don t mind,4,2020-06-10 07:01:26,0,
good app and so close to what i was looking for but it s missing one thing if you could add an option to add your own tasks without it having to be an actual event that d be awesome i don t want to add wake up or gym as an event in my calendar,4,2020-06-09 01:19:27,19,
i d say it s great,4,2020-06-07 15:11:59,0,
good visualisation would be great if the widget came in a dark version as well and transparency could be set,4,2020-06-07 13:39:31,0,
this is a good apps but i think it will be better if the widget will show in the lockscreen too so it will be easier to check the plan but offer all this is a good apps still find no problem up till now maybe i ll try the premium version to see the more features,4,2020-06-04 22:11:27,8,
it is a nice application,4,2020-06-01 08:06:53,0,
annoying that you can t change the color background of the dial with the free version but otherwise very useful and fun to use,4,2020-06-01 00:48:26,1,
seems good for people who use a calendar already but i hate google calenders and outlook alike i couldn t figure out how to create my schedule without using one of those terrible calendars so i uninstalled,4,2020-05-31 23:15:46,0,
really nicely made and very useful app and always a looker for others recently however it always shows some phantom alarm clocks i did not set,4,2020-05-30 18:10:15,0,
wish for larger text difficult to read,4,2020-05-30 16:55:27,0,
really great but no project task relationships that i could find so grouping things is hard except coloring them manually,4,2020-05-28 16:32:45,2,
this is good application for the procrastinators who usually wasted their time on phone without any reason i like the sectograph because it let me push to do the work of hat makes any sense so i recommend you to use this application,4,2020-05-28 13:41:04,2,
i like the graphic,4,2020-05-26 05:20:45,0,
useful but still needs more integration to outlook i d like to load my colour categories that i already have in outlook calendar in my visualization calendar by week numbers is also a must have i d like to know also the percentage of availability of each day based on my events it could also integrate with my alarm in order to know at what time i wake up and so on the potential of this app is huge,4,2020-05-24 13:14:34,12,
very good app the only note is that it takes a while to make it syncronizing properly but after you get it works like a charm,4,2020-05-23 04:42:22,2,
very cool app for keeping track of your tasks and schedule,4,2020-05-22 21:29:25,0,

cute love it but bugs no alarms that s the only thing keeping it from being 5 stars for me,4,2020-05-16 15:45:26,0,
good android widget for watching planned schedules everytime at ease on the home screen for syncing all calenders to view birthdays events at one place,4,2020-05-15 11:21:49,0,
i really like this app i find the the way it presents the data in a clock face with countdowns to your events very useful the one drawback for me is that it doesn t integrate with google tasks or reminders this means that everything you want to see needs to be created as an event this is not a massive deal but i do like the convenience of tasks over events the widget sometimes loses synchronisation with the clock and shows a different time than the actual time,4,2020-05-15 00:46:13,105,
just please add reminders notifications with custom sound and more colors and please make the wedge icon display description of the event or auto degrease the letters size to fit more than 1 word or add a fieldnto type title that will be shown edited in the app even it comes from another planner without titles,4,2020-05-11 19:27:05,9,
love it just need galaxy watch face even paid fair price,4,2020-05-09 06:53:53,0,
excellent work,4,2020-05-07 01:59:23,0,
best app works perfect but giving 4 stars due to colour settings whenever you try to change colour of tasks there is a problem that you touch a colour and it selects other colour like touch red colour it selects blue this problem is in all colours,4,2020-05-06 21:20:31,0,
this is a great app but i dun like it link to my calendar because it will mess them up prefer if this is a standalone calendar so that i can separate my schedule in this app and other schedule in my calendar,4,2020-05-06 08:50:17,17,

how to make the sectograph appear in the home screen,4,2020-04-10 17:11:06,0,"Hi,
To place the widget on the home screen, long press on an empty spot on the home screen and press ""Widgets"".  Find the widget and drag it to your home screen.
After that, make a long press on the widget and drag it to the desired size."
the app is real good and helps in improving the productivity an improvement that could be made is to hasten the sync up with the calendar it is taking quite a long time to reflect in the sectrograph after adding any new event,4,2020-04-09 11:01:28,1,
great app to track your daily schedule one thing what would be great to have here displaying the scheduled reminders from google calendar unfortunately i do not see them,4,2020-04-07 13:45:22,0,
very effective i would give 5 stars but writting space too little larger writting space will help much better,4,2020-04-07 13:21:30,0,
really fun view of your day still figuring out how to use it well it would be nice for the widget palette to also be visible inside the app but it s not a huge issue i could easily see myself changing to 5 stars once i get used to it,4,2020-04-07 08:55:45,0,
it is a good app really ok but i don t like that you oblige me to rate this is a no go,4,2020-04-03 19:03:13,0,Sorry for that. And yet thanks for your rating 😊

good app but not exactly what i was looking for this app uses your calendar events and organizes them in the circle the controls are great i love when i move the red time bar it scrolls through all the things and shows the time changing love the widget i wanted this to work out a homeschool schedule i ended up having to make a new calendar and syncing only that one i was able to change the colors of each event in the app very easy to use overall,4,2020-03-28 23:20:34,49,

i really like the app it s pretty cool how do i get the 24 hr clock on my android wear 5 stars if the 24hr face can is possible on the watch,4,2020-03-17 16:13:32,0,"Hi,  
It is possible.  Go to the settings for synchronizing with the smart watch (on the device).  And configure the action by tapping on the screen.  Set the mode to 12/24.  Voila 😎"
i started using this app in 11th std i m getting its benifit but the only thing is that it doesnt shows the tasks we have to complete in some monutes or if two tasks are to be completed simultaneously in a hour so i humbly request to make some more changes in this app so that everyone can use it more comfortably,4,2020-03-17 09:48:12,0,
neat but i don t put that much stuff on my calendar looking for more of a scheduling tool for everyday routines don t want to add all that stuff to my calendar,4,2020-03-09 21:21:34,0,
now realize will not show appointments over 12 hours out however would think should see them in overall list but not on widget good but could be just tad better,4,2020-03-08 08:20:31,1,"Hi,  
Check that there are events for the current 12 hours.  Email me at 27applab@gmail.com, I will help"
it took me a while to understand how to use certain features but once i did i found it to be exactly what i needed if google would allow reminders to come through it would be the perfect time management tool my only thought would be if there was some sort of tutorial or guide to help know what some things were for like when i m changing the color scheme i can t always tell what s what for those not wanting their calendar clogged up just make those things hidden after you ve added them,4,2020-02-29 22:49:21,59,
thanks to you this app makes me more concentrated and schedulable in my days and its efficient visual time widget on the home screen is really practical but sync between calendar and app is a little time consuming,4,2020-02-28 11:39:14,2,
this app is very helpful but you need to control yourself to done schedule on time,4,2020-02-24 13:32:41,0,

lot more easy and practical maintaining calendar is fun loved the widget,4,2020-02-19 08:14:20,0,
best watch once you understand it it takes a while to set up just the way you want it and to actually get it but once you do it does exactly what it promises its sleek yet informative and by far the best at a glance app for your homescreen the watch addon is the cherry on the cake only improvement in my opinion would be to add multiple different widgets like give me the option for a small simple one on my home screen and a bigger more detailed one on my office screen for instance,4,2020-02-18 21:30:32,40,
i love this widget it s such a clear picture of the time and schedule my only thing is i wish it was compatible for the galaxy watch i got the app because i saw it on the watch i m the pictures but it doesn t work with the galaxy watch if this was improved to work with the watch i would give it 5 stars,4,2020-02-18 19:16:13,4,

a very good pie chart graphical view of your schedule with nice colours and everything is good about the app specially the graphical side i m not a pro owner but also rating 4 stars because of the glitch in app today my whole sector were invisible today and it just showed blue colour filled circle with only an area of 45 looking as faded blue and nothing else was there i also have screen shot of the error if developers need it else it s a great app soon will buy the pro version,4,2019-12-31 20:59:00,2,

We made the default ability to click on sectors of the widget.
To return, click on the widget button (upper right corner of the widget) and ""Customize widget buttons"".  Choose the first option"
beautiful,4,2019-12-19 15:30:28,0,
i bought the pro version and like it so far for now what i m really missing is the ability to change days from the widget itself with the left and right arrows and not only from inside the app why wouldn t you enable the left and right arrows to change day as default having to go into the app to review past or coming days defeats the purpose of the widget and forces you to use something else other than the widget itself other than that the app seems to be very practical if the ability to swipe from one day to the next day or to the last day from the widget gets implemented it would be a 5 star app for me thanks,4,2019-12-18 21:20:17,16,
i ve been using this app and the watch face on my moto 360 for close to about a year now with all my events for the day and the next day visible on my wrist i can keep track of my calendar easily however recently the watch face is defaulting to simple clock default watch face whenever i use the watch it only affects sectograph and it has been bugging me since,4,2019-12-13 16:04:37,8,"Hi, Reinstall the app on the smart watch.

amazing app one of the main reasons i like having a smart watch is to keep track of my appointments on my wrist and this has been one of if not the best way i ve tried of having easy visual access to my daily agenda the visuals is seeing the hand move towards my meetings and the time listed until then is a great touch as well,5,2020-10-26 10:14:04,2,

In Pixels there should be no need of any special configuration. We have a Pixel 2 and the app runs correctly.

i found it odd that the app didn t have preset hourly reminders most people have habits that require them to do them on specific hours for example gyming twice or thrice a day the app should have a feature on where you can input the exact times in the day when it should remind you another example of this would be reminder on every thursdays at 7am and 8pm i should be reminded of insert habit instead it s jungle of toggles that seem to not make sense,1,2019-02-08 07:49:32,2,"Thank you very much for giving more details.

app is good but the programmer feature is bad i have created multiple small routines which i want to enable from programmer based on my work meetings for different days so if i have late meetings on wed and fri i want to enable a separate set of routines for these days similarly for weekends the programmer is allowing for just dates which is not the feature that i bought the pro version for i want small reusable routines that i can configure from programmer for days not periods of dates,2,2019-08-26 02:41:54,0,"Hi Siddharth.

edit been using it for a while occasionally and every time it feels like a hassle to find what i need to reach within the app i only use the routines no events or reminders i have a separate app for that google assistant wit a calendar to add a change to one day it requires a lot of clicking to amend it i end up writing down the rest of the day tasks on paper deleting amending the times and adding them manually with the new times that s counterproductive i need an easy way to move,2,2019-05-22 11:03:16,3,"Thank you very much for your feedback, Alex.

very bad app i organised all of my activities took me 1 hour to complete my planner then realised that the app automatically sets the time at am so all my afternoon activities where at the morning for example if i had to eat at 1pm it said that i had to eat at 1am so i changed them to pm and suddenly the app errased my whole schedule wasting 1 hour,2,2019-04-08 23:12:40,39,"Hi, sorry you're experiencing trouble. The time picker includes a button to select am or pm, do you mean it didn't work correctly? Apart from this, there's an undo option on the top submenu for accidental deletions.

really weird formatting i m trying to be more organized not get a brain workout trying to figure out an app,2,2018-12-13 02:23:36,0,"Hi. We recommend to take a look at our starting guide (https://timetune.center/android-help/). Once you get the idea, you'll see it's very easy (and useful).

wasn t sure to begin with as it s not all that user friendly but how frustrating to take a chance anyway pay for premium only to have it not sync with my calendars wasn t really any other reason to pay for premium except that what a small waste of money it s of no use to me now,2,2018-11-29 14:45:51,3,"Hi, about your questions: 1) If you need it, there's a 'Getting started' guide on the help section (https://timetune.center/android-help/). 2) For the moment the calendar sync is from Google Calendar to TimeTune, we'd like to make it both ways in the future. 3) If you need a refund please contact by email, we don't want anybody to waste their money"
don t like the new changes,2,2018-11-27 01:16:16,0,"Hi. We're still evaluating different options, but we need more details. Which things do you find most difficult in the new interface?"
everything i wanted it for i had to do the pro mode,2,2018-11-21 13:20:50,0,"Hi Tova. The app is still evolving and the pro features might change. If you tell us which feature you needed, it will help us make decisions. Thanks."
android keep blocking the app from sending notifications i ve re downloaded it and put an exception for it in the battery settings to work without interruption but nothing happens fix it,2,2018-11-06 17:39:12,0,"Hi. If the message still appears, something in the system is still blocking the app. Many times it's not enough to put an exception in the battery settings. You may need to assign auto-start permission, prevent the app from being killed when screen is off or pin the app to the list of recent apps. More info: https://timetune.center/troubleshooting/"
the new interface is cluttered and hard to use edited in response to the query below in the older interface a routine had a separate page for each day of the week now it s a continuous scroll the older approach seems cleaner,2,2018-10-26 14:13:08,1,"Thank you very much for giving more details, Shruti 👍"
i ve been trying to figure out how to have a custom time set for the add notification options and there doesn t seem to be any way for example i need to set it to 1 hour and 30 minutes but there s no option for that we need the ability to enter exactly the number of minutes and hours we want instead of only having presets edit now after using it for a while the app has been plagued with reliability issues it often is late with the notification by a few minutes or the service completely stops and i d have to restart the service due to this issue i cannot rely on this app for anything that is time sensitive because i d end up being late for all my appointments and jobs i ve contacted the developer multiple times about this but so far they haven t been able to fix the issue,2,2018-10-16 00:06:33,4,"We're really sorry about this, Rob. The culprit usually is the battery configuration on the device, but your case has been especially tough. We'll try to locate your same device model to make more tests. Thanks."
the most recent update just made it harder to move times around,2,2018-10-11 07:28:33,1,"Hi, thanks for your feedback. We'll be refining the interface in successive versions. Thanks for your understanding."
it is better if don t have buy pro version hoping an app free offline soon,2,2018-10-02 21:47:33,0,"Hi. You don't need to pay to use TimeTune. We only have three pro features but none of them is essential. You can create as many routines, reminders, timers and events as you need for free. Thanks."
i was recommended this app by a friend who loves it i got the premium version as i expected it to have better features this app is very confusing to use i even went to the help section and was even more confused i m very disappointed,2,2018-10-02 07:14:18,1,"Hi Makiya. We're sorry you feel that way. The project is still young and more improvements will be added progressively. If you need a refund, please contact by email and we'll do it, there's no problem in that."
it is a good idea but it s not really easy to use in fact it s quite complicated i bought premium because they advertised i could set schedules per day and i can but not how i had hoped i recommend to make it simpler by allowing the user to toggle days per schedule in the routine editor and additionally make any small changes in each individual day,2,2018-10-01 20:55:56,15,"Thank you very much for your feedback, we really appreciate it. If you want a refund, please contact by email and we'll do it. There's no problem in that. Thanks."
routines don t last forever any more,2,2018-09-24 08:21:47,0,Hi Reuben. Nothing has changed regarding routines. If you contact by email we can help you find what's happening. Thanks.
genuinely not a good app,2,2018-09-19 01:25:25,0,Hi. Explain the reason and we'll make it better. Deal?
while it certainly wasn t expensive it was a waste of money in the fact that i found this app to do very little more than any calendar after reading the faq it says it s more than a calendar how especially since adding anything is done in the same way you create a calendar event the routine function is a missed opportunity in that i think it will help me establish a morning routine for myself but in reality it s about creating calendar events that repeat a slightly expanded component of any free calendar our there when i think of tuning my time spent i m thinking better organization for smaller tasks then find myself spending an hour setting 1 minute events for myself that i was never actually notified about lol what irony unfortunately it was not time or money well spent,2,2018-08-15 08:12:03,0,"Hi. We don't want anyone to waste their money. If you contact by email we'll make a refund, no problem. Apart from this, keep in mind that the project is still evolving.

u should work on the phones like oppo and others so that customer don t find problem,2,2018-08-11 00:24:34,0,"Hi. If you are referring to the message saying that the app has been blocked by the system, this happens because Oppo devices block background tasks by default, it's not a fault with the app. You can find generic instructions for Oppo here: https://timetune.center/troubleshooting/ (but we recommend to make a Google search for your specific model)."

i really liked the app helped me a lot with managing my time efficiently to get the most out of my day but since i updated it it started acting up it use to be so easy to simply move routine blocks around and now it s setting it s own times or plainly refusing to be moved to a later time block which is infuriating and the app also slowed down considerably after the update,2,2018-06-27 20:06:50,1,Hi. We'd like to investigate this bug. If you could please contact by email it would be of great help. Thanks.
a core function missing is the ability to disable a routine daily occurrence for a specific day for example i usually exercise from 6pm to 8pm every day so i created an event that happens every monday to friday today is a thursday and due to an unexpected occurrence i can t exercise today i wanted to change that my 6 8pm block of time just today but can only do so by deleting the event for every monday to thursday to clear my timeline makes no sense to clear that block of time and need to re create that exercise block for all the other monday to fridays if something unexpected happens at 6pm next friday i ll have to delete it alll and recreate all over again after just to clear my timeline if you get this core feature right then the app would be complete,2,2018-06-21 14:11:59,5,"Hi. We don't understand your request. Routines can already be disabled temporarily using the main switch, you don't need to delete the activities. If you created an event (Main menu / Events), keep in mind that they have nothing to do with routines. If you meant a different thing, please contact by email to give more details. Thanks."

tried to plan my weekly schedule with the routines function but it kept randomly changing the times of the events as i made other edits for example an event i set for 4pm changed to 11am when i hit the button add break before event also annoying that you can t preview the notification sounds and have to add silly tags to each event such as housework,2,2018-03-31 10:19:08,0,"Hi. Routines work with blocks of time. If you click on an empty block and select 'Add gap to next activity', that block will be added to the next activity, therefore the start time must change. Tags are what allow to see statistics about your distribution of time. If you prefer a more traditional approach, you can use the Events section instead."

so far i like it i thought there would be an option to sync your routine from the google calendar but apparently you can only sync the timeline the time tune staff has been very helpful and the app has alot of potential,2,2018-03-17 03:36:56,0,"Hi Harry.

this app is a good idea and i like the fact that it is very good to start healthy habits an get organized but yet i could not do anything even with the little tutorial at the beginning this app was no help to me all i recommend is that the app has to be a bit more self explanatory i did not know how to do anything,2,2018-03-06 06:01:20,0,"Hi.

i regret buying this app tl dr don t use this app if you ever intend on changing routines or planning changing existing routines is very hard as it simply deletes whatever overlaps in time so unnecessary and impossible to revert if you accidentally click pm instead of am once your whole day is deleted permanently also every time i want to sync between my phone and my tablet i have to export it to google drive and then import it from the other device also you can t copy items or days to another time please make this app more user friendly,2,2018-02-19 13:59:59,0,"Hi Anna.

tried it out the time function which is 90 of the app imho is clunky the default end time is until next activity but then it automatically changes to the start time of the next activity and you can t change it back then if you add a task that overlaps other start times it deletes the other activities i spent 15 minutes setting up a schedule and was frustrated to find that i had erased my entire afternoon schedule because i made a mistake when changing the end time of something mid day this app was for me ironically a waste of time,2,2018-01-22 21:06:53,0,"Thanks for the feedback, Joshua. 'Until next activity' is there to avoid having to calculate the time yourself, but you can change it after that. Activities don't work like to-do's, they work like chunks of time. If a chunk of time overlaps another one, it'll get overwritten, but the app warns you with a message. That said, we are still improving."

not intuitive for my use seems like you have to create routines rather than just simply track activities,2,2017-05-30 10:46:39,0,"Hi Tom. As explained on the description, TimeTune is a routine management app, not an activity tracker. So we think it's a bit unfair to give a low rating if you are searching for something different. No one wants to be valued for something they're not. We hope you understand."
this app is ok but i don t understand why i cannot see the whole month or a graph showing what amount off time i spent doing individual activities i spent a little while tagging and creating different routines you won t be able to merge multiple routines it will delete the first thing you merged or any activity you added if this doesn t improve you might as well use google apps instead there is nothing too special about this app i regret paying for it,2,2017-05-26 04:04:39,0,"Hi, first of all if you want a refund just contact by email and we'll do it, there's no problem in that.

very confusing i couldn t even set a daily reminder edit to have a daily reminder i need to create a routine set number of days whatever that means to 1 open it add an activity create a new tag for it cause i can t just give it a simple name then go back and enable the routine that s extremely confusing as for a simple thing like this don t want to do this again,2,2017-05-16 20:31:59,1,"This is not true.

i have been searching for months for a schedule planner that uses a continuous alarm until i switch it off myself yours is actually great and i would rate it at least a 4 if the alarm worked properly the old nokia i used some time ago had a built in app that did the job properly,2,2017-02-24 01:16:56,1,"Did you check the troubleshooting section before giving a low rating?

this scheduler is severely lacking basic and simple features the reminder function needs to give the user the option to select specific and multiple days of the week and dates he or she wants the reminder to repeat itself daily weekly monthly and yearly aren t good enough i want certain reminders to only be for weekdays weekends and e g mondays and saturdays the reminder function needs to be able to repeat itself multiple times in a day when certain events are coming up i want to be reminded 24 hours 1 hour and 5 minutes before to the event the reminder function also needs an option to decide the duration of the sound and vibration i m sometimes not close to to my phone and might miss the reminder when it only rings for a few seconds or even a few minutes and make it so that you can also set the time with the keypad not only by turning the clock arms around,2,2016-12-23 06:03:56,1,"Hi Marita.

you can t see your whole week schedule on just one page so if you wanted to schedule something with someone you have to flip through each single day also when you create specific events they aren t incorporated into your routine for a single period cycle they are two separate things so you may get a notification about it beforehand but when you look through your weeks schedule it doesnt show up there it s great for routines but doesn t incorpotate events into your week which is hard for scheduling,2,2016-10-25 07:18:39,0,"Thank you very much for your feedback, Spencer.

good idea but needs work i don t like the fact that it will not let you create to routine events at the same time for example if i add a routine event named alone time and i said it from 3 pm to 5 pm and then i create another routine event from 3 p m to 3 15 and i named it having a meal it will override it will not create it that needs to be fixed,2,2016-09-20 04:09:46,3,"Hi Jesse.

i love the layout and different features two things that i would love changed or added are 1 the ability to either edit a routine for a singular day or to clear a routine from a singular day like when i have an atypical day and can t follow my regular routine and 2 the ability to see the overlap in events routines if two different things occur at the same time,3,2020-06-08 10:27:16,22,"Hi thank you very much for your suggestions 👍 Indeed, those are two features we'd like to add in future versions 🙂"

used to work really well now the notifications wont work on my xiaomi phone rendering ot pretty much useless and i tried everything,3,2020-06-05 03:01:16,0,Hi.

seems ok atm but i can t tune the alarm off when a task pops up,3,2020-05-30 04:38:13,0,Hi Dan. The sound should stop when you remove the notification from the notification area. Is that what you were looking for?
i like it just try it,3,2020-05-27 21:41:27,0,
it s kinda cool but the alarm icon disappear immediately the app is closed and therefore do not show notification when the time set is due,3,2020-05-25 18:55:54,0,"Hi, that happens because the device's battery settings are blocking the app. You can see how to solve it here 👉 https://dontkillmyapp.com/ 👉 https://timetune.help/en/troubleshooting/ 👉 https://www.undoze.com/a/soundprofile"

love the routine schedule i help you to create i m horrible at establishing routines sticking to them so i need help like this,3,2020-05-09 02:23:10,0,
this is a good app it has background issues i have refresh to make it notifications work,3,2020-05-07 14:35:32,0,"Hi.

We recommend to check https://dontkillmyapp.com/ But if that's not enough, we strongly recommend to ask in Tecno forums for instructions about your specific device model. Thanks."
i don t like that it forgets the settings like repeat daily no notification etc so you have to change it every time also no way to stop the vibration when selecting certain things also when you add a new event the date gets to the next day and after it says that you can only input less than 24 hours bottom line good idea finicky to use,3,2020-05-03 04:19:54,0,"Hi. About the first two issues (settings and vibration), please contact us at timetuneapp@gmail.com, they look like a misunderstanding and there might already be a solution.

please improve the persistent notification when i close the app it get removed it should be there for all time,3,2020-04-29 15:36:44,1,"Hi.

great idea such a usefully app we did have the ability to sync with our calendar the widgets were super cute and looked amazing on my phone however the alarm system isn t the best i would have troubles switching it off because it wasn t in the notification bar and there was no popup for me to turn it off if have to switch off my phone which was really irritating thank you,3,2020-04-23 05:50:43,0,"Hi, sorry about that. We'll open an investigation. Meanwhile, there's a trick to avoid the problem.

works okay if you re looking for routine alarm but not exactly as a motivation and control of routines,3,2020-04-16 21:26:00,0,Hi Romulo! Thanks for your feedback 👍 Please stay tuned. The app is still evolving and we'll be adding improvements progressively 🙂 Cheers!
the alarms set are not going off when they re supposed to,3,2020-04-13 20:51:16,1,"The usual cause is the battery management policy implemented by the manufacturer.

i liked this app in its previous form but they have been reducing options one of my favorite thing was the repeat by minutes option it s gone,3,2020-04-12 01:03:40,0,"Hi.

i m still trying it out but so far it has helped a lot one would not waste time if they have this app in hand,3,2020-04-01 22:05:53,0,
this is a decent time managment app the ability to create routines is handy though it doesnt warn you or show if activities are overlapping the most recent update as of 3 30 2020 made the app look much cleaner which is nice i would like to see more personalization options t wards the look af the tags and app choices now are very slim the 5 price tag for the pro version doesn t feel worth it yes buyer s remorse so if you can manage fine with the free version stick with that,3,2020-03-31 23:59:23,24,"Hi, thank you very much for your feedback 👍 We keep working on new improvements for the app 👷‍♀️ Stay tuned for more changes in 2020 🙂"

it s usefull but would be much nicer if there was an option to play a notification tone just once instead of repeating it continuously,3,2020-03-13 12:05:03,1,Hi. The app shows all the sounds from the device (repetitive and non-repetitive). You just need to select a non-repetitive sound. Is that what you were looking for?
hi thanks for responding and i ll be more specific please bring back the pretty orange background for the top bar and each of the routines the current color is too pale,3,2020-02-19 13:34:27,7,Thanks for giving more details 👍 We take note of the idea 📝

i was using journal but can t write much until my hand gets better so i was looking for the app to plan my day preciously by time thought time line of this app would work like all the icon and pre made taps but disappointed that i can not use those icons by itself for my event unless you creat another routine if dev s can modify the app that makes all those taps can be added to timeline by itself with my own time not only as events or routine that would be perfect thanks,3,2020-02-14 21:30:18,2,"Hi, we don't fully understand your suggestion.

pretty good could be better,3,2020-02-08 06:31:59,0,Hi! What feature would you like to see in TimeTune? We're open to suggestions 🙂
this is a very cool app and thus have the ratings how ever it will be nice if you can add the functionality of sharing task or even with other users this will make it the all in one project task manager review update previously i was able to pick custom tags when setting a new event but now i can t and i have to pick a color and look for the same icon each time i want to create a new event this is counter productive as the main aim of the app is to help optimize time please fix this,3,2020-02-03 22:25:04,0,"Hi, please contact us at timetuneapp@gmail.com and we'll find what's happening.

tried this app for a bit the logic is very different from what i need so the experience wasn t good this app focuses on routines and is built around this concept it was very confusing at first because it started with abstract ideas not what average joe is already familiar with e g calendar timeline and the entire experience just felt awkward for me all i want is see the day week month add to do items one by one and be able to turn any of these items into routines when i want to,3,2020-01-31 01:04:56,0,"Hi! It seems you're looking for a standard to-do app or habits app. We recommend to search for those terms instead. Although TimeTune was not what you needed, thanks a lot for trying our app! 🙂👍"

i like the ideas of the app however the biggest inconvience for me is when something happens that disrupts my routines there doesn t seem to be anyway to change the routine for one day with out changing it for every day in the futurs as well it is annoying to have to manualy change a routine and then have to change it back the next day i would like to see an option to edit or rearrage single intances of items in the time line without effecting the base routine or future dates,3,2020-01-11 06:52:27,31,"Hi! Thank you very much for your feedback 👍 Indeed, this is an option we'd like to add in future versions 🙂"
stupid decision to remove timer,3,2020-01-07 17:24:41,0,"Hi, sorry about the timers. It has been a difficult decision for us, but we remain open to all possibilities for the future. Are you in favor of a new app only for timers but with more powerful features?"
it s ok but i wish i could move activities around in a routine instead of having to manually change the time one by one e g if i have yoga 9 10 then study 10 12 and want to swap them i can t just move around the blocks i have to delete study change the time of yoga then add study with the new time it s time consuming and not practical would also be good to be able to change settings of a routine e g from 4 days to 2 instead of deleting the entire routine and start over,3,2020-01-06 04:46:55,3,"Hi! You can already swap blocks by long-clicking on a block and using the arrows on the top bar 🙂 About changing the number the days in a routine, you don't need to start over. You can create a new routine with the desired amount of days and quickly import your activities from the old routine with the 'Import day' option from the top submenu 😉"
i sadly had to uninstall this app as tgere was no general opt out option for direct marketing activity i could opt out of seeing personalised ads on this app i couldnt opt of my data being collected and combined with other sources and shared by all of their many advertising partners which for an app like this is just too invasive very saddened as the app does look really good,3,2020-01-05 04:32:47,2,"Hi! If you opted out of personalized ads, no data is collected at all. Maybe we just need to change the text to explain it better. Can you confirm that this was the problem?

i used to use this app to set intervals of when i would check in to games i was playing but since they removed the timer feature for some reason the scheduling stuff doesn t suit my purposes still the app should be able to help you maintain a schedule just fine but most phones have that feature built in,3,2020-01-04 22:21:54,2,"Hi, thanks for your feedback 👍 If we create an app just for timers, with more powerful features, would you use it?

my original review seems to have disappeared i have an issue on my galaxy note s8 where i can t turn off the alarms without uninstalling i received a response from support but couldn t respond directly their response was simply that i should be able to swipe the notification and the sound go away yes i agree that should happen however that isn t what happens there is no notification from the app for the alarm i receive other notifications from the app running out of room to explain,3,2019-10-22 18:14:17,0,Hi Cassie.

i think the app should request permission over other apps or if possible have it as a widget it keeps getting inactive when removed from recent files tab of the phone,3,2019-09-02 15:45:03,0,"Hi Manu.

it s really only useful if you are doing recurring tasks at the same time on the same days etc i set up a lot of tags categories but they can only be applied to the routines not events or reminders i was also not able to copy duplicate events which would have allowed me to reuse the same tasks at different times or days without setting up a brand new event disappointed in the app s scheduling capabilities,3,2019-06-30 04:55:36,1,Hi Carrie.

some features are to be paid,3,2019-04-25 18:04:57,0,"Hi Sourabh. Remember that there are only three premium features but none of them is essential. You can use as many routines, reminders, timers and events as you need for free. Thanks."
no reminder tone else 5 star,3,2019-04-15 11:40:27,0,"Hi. OnePlus devices include many settings to block notifications. Please check instructions for OnePlus here: https://dontkillmyapp.com/oneplus  If the problem is only the sound, you can contact us at timetuneapp@gmail.com and we can help. Thanks."
this app is useful but it would be so much more useful if you could set a routine to be repeated every weekday weekend day week 2week 4week month etc it is badly in need of this feature i thought buying pro would allow me to do this and it hasn t helped at all and i m disappointed i spent the money please say that it is an upcoming feature resetting routines for every day is really inconvenient,3,2019-04-07 17:30:14,4,"Hi! When you have a moment, please contact by email at timetuneapp@gmail.com and tell us a bit more about your schedule. We're open to adding a feature like this, but we need more details in order to find a solution that works for everyone. Additionally, we can make a refund too. Thanks!"
great concept,3,2019-04-03 21:40:12,0,
ui can be improved more rounded corners instead of hard corners it makes the app look more modern my opinion,3,2019-04-01 16:39:03,0,"Hi! We want to improve UI, but we need more details. Tell us please what you didn't like and we'll make it better. Thanks!"
bit complicated in adding routines i didn t understood,3,2019-04-01 00:09:01,0,"Hi! We recommend to take a look at our 'Getting started' guide: https://timetune.center/android-help/  Once you get the idea, you'll see it's very easy 😃"
the layout for the app is awesome but it would be better if non routine task can be added into the timeline with the same activity for routine task,3,2019-03-30 23:52:28,0,
the app is good but it would be better if it had a timeline please do something about that,3,2019-03-30 18:11:57,0,"Hi. Thanks for your feedback, but we need more details. The application already has a timeline section (Main menu / Timeline). Do you mean a different kind of timeline? You can point us to another app as an example. Thanks."
app is good but i want to suggest something there should be to do list type of feature that is what sort of things we are doing regularly from our routine will be selected and those which left undone will be not selected in this way more clear picture of time allotment and productivity can be seen,3,2019-03-28 23:48:14,1,"Thank you very much for your suggestion, Kamlesh 👍😃"
this is so complicated it took me awhile to to figure all the stuff i would suggest add some tutorial on youtube so anyone can get used to it and the app is solid and will think about purchasing the pro version,3,2019-03-24 22:41:50,0,"Hi Alan! You're right. The app is still evolving and some things are not intuitive yet. Our intention is to improve everything progressively. Meanwhile, we recommend to take a look at our 'Getting started' guide to know how the basics work: https://timetune.center/android-help/"
just tested the pro version needs to be more stable sometimes my work starts at 12 am and it doesn t sync with my google calendar widget needs to be fine tuned not quite satisfied so 3 stars,3,2019-03-15 00:52:45,0,"Hi! You can make work start at any time you like. If you need help, contact by email and we'll show you how.

i love this app so far but the notifications are not really working for me,3,2019-03-14 09:41:08,0,Hi! This happens because the device is blocking our background tasks by default. You can see how to solve it here: https://timetune.center/troubleshooting/
not practical,3,2019-03-14 04:56:10,0,"Hi, thanks for your feedback. Keep in mind that the project is still young and evolving. If you tell us the things you didn't like, we'll make them better. Your opinion is important. Thank you very much."
the app is overall good just bought the upgraded version since i wanted to sync the google calender i still cannot sync the google calender into the calender and also would like to know if sync the routine from timetune into the google calender is possible thanks,3,2019-03-13 14:04:39,0,"Hi! For the moment, the sync feature allows to see calendar events in TimeTune's timeline. Going the other way (from TimeTune to the Calendar) is something we're considering for the future. If you have problems with the sync feature, please click on 'Settings / Advanced / Send technical report' and put your name at the end, so we can help. Thanks!"
its a good way to manage your time but after a while the timeline menu bugs out and stops sending notifications besides that the app is very good,3,2019-03-07 22:58:40,0,Hi! In Samsung devices this happens because the power saving mode is blocking our application. You can see how to solve this here: https://timetune.center/troubleshooting/
its good i like the little picture icons i wish for 2 things that you can share as a jpg file and not a txt file to email and that the length of the boxes represented the amount of time used for example snack time would be a short box sleep would be a long box thanks,3,2019-03-04 17:53:31,0,"Thank you very much for your suggestions, Tiffany! 👍😃"
i love this app i would really love an option to check off or mark that a task was complete,3,2019-03-04 04:17:02,0,Hi Jeni! Thank you very much for your suggestion 👍 This is a possibility we're considering for the future of the app 😃
hi please provide accepted pending decline tags on rutine notifications of activites and also show day progress for these tags or activites in app i think it will force the mind to follow daily schedule,3,2019-03-03 12:52:23,0,"Thank you very much for your suggestions, Mohit! This is a possibility we're considering for future updates."
i bought the pro version in hope i can organize my time to do my tasks but the progrmer just disables the routine that s all really the other thing i didn t like was to set a routine for a reoccurring like school or sleep i had to set it for every single day one by one you could have add a reapet feature to it i m not happy i wish i could get my money back,3,2019-02-26 20:38:47,0,"Hi. The programmer allows to schedule any routine in a specific date or period (check that the default program is not set as 'All routines disabled'). About activities, you can create only one and make use of the clone option (long-click and clone). In any case, if you prefer a refund please contact by email and we'll do it, no problem. Thanks."
not too bad,3,2019-02-20 19:02:37,0,
great potential but i can t use the app to its full extent due to its counter intuitive layout just filling two days in routine view turned it into an endless scroll shame the app really looked like what i was looking for reply thanks for taking my review into account yes i think a horisontal orientation would be much better maybe leave both options that way everyone can decide what best suits them,3,2019-02-17 05:52:59,0,Hi! Sorry about that. Would it work for you if the days were in horizontal?
really don t like that they changed the empty time slots back to the way they were whenever you delete an activity the activity gets replaced with an empty block separate from the empty blocks before or after it i find it to be extremely unnecessary but the new feature of increasing or decreasing an activity in 1 5 or 15 minute chunks is great and the programmer feature works well as always particularly good for planning out studies and work,3,2019-02-16 04:01:46,30,"Hi Angela! Thank you very much for your feedback, we really appreciate it 😃 The thing about empty blocks is a trade-off. If we want empty blocks to be movable, we cannot join them automatically (and vice versa). So, we preferred to give the user the freedom to manage their blocks as they need. Remember you can join the blocks if you need it too."
it is useful but not the perfect,3,2019-02-12 12:24:34,0,Hi! What would you like to add or change? Your feedback will help make TimeTune better. Thanks! 😃
the concept is quite elligant yet also hard and confusing to understand it would be eaier if there was a calendar setting and or addition to help the user plan along with a timeline,3,2019-02-12 06:43:24,0,"Hi! Thank you very much for your feedback. You're right, some things are not intuitive yet. Our intention is to refine the app in successive versions."
this is good but you need to update where we can sync on our desktop or another phone via google or else,3,2019-02-11 09:50:11,0,Hi! Thanks a lot for your suggestion 👍 The app is still young but this is a possibility we're considering for the future 😃
i like this app but in the world of time schedule management you have to be multi platform i would recommend that your next step in development is a web interface as the majority of a professionals day is spent on a pc or laptop,3,2019-02-05 22:12:18,0,"Hi! Thank you very much for your suggestion 👍 We're definitely open to this possibility, provided the project grows as expected 📈 Cheers!"
im sure the pro version is great but it didn t keep my interest long enough,3,2019-02-02 01:00:01,0,
i used to love this app but now it has been ruined made things more complicated and v can t assign according to days of week,3,2019-01-30 13:02:29,0,"Hi, we're sorry to hear that. Please tell us exactly which things you find difficult and we'll look into it, we want to help. If you prefer, you can contact by email at timetuneapp@gmail.com for better communication. Thanks."

how to view statistics,3,2019-01-25 00:34:21,0,"Hi Nicole! To view the routine statistics, just tap on the statistics icon that appears on each routine card. Apart from this, when you open a routine each day has a 'Day summary' submenu option too. That being said, our intention is to add more and better statistics in future versions 📈😃"
it s simple and easy to use but notification often doesn t work about 10 times a day,3,2019-01-20 05:26:40,0,Hi! This happens because the device configuration is blocking our background tasks. You can see how to solve it here: https://timetune.center/troubleshooting/

sometimes it stops working so you have to refresh the background tasks but it s a nice app,4,2020-10-27 22:09:29,0,
if your phone isn t giving you notifications go to settings notifications output channel and change it to alarm it will make a sound timetune it would be smart to make this the default setting vibration still not working on samsung s10,4,2020-10-26 21:28:21,0,"Hi, about the vibration, please click on 'Settings / Advanced / Send technical report'.

great app one star cut for not being available at ios because i also have ipad and i want it to be on that too,4,2020-10-23 08:12:46,0,"Thanks for your suggestion 👍 We're open to that possibility for the future 🙂 However, the project needs to grow more before we can justify the investment 📈"
hi timetune i love your app since then i just have a problem i don t know how to fix the blockage of timetune app on my infinix hot 9 your site for troubleshooting is not accessible for me overall this app is fine and satisfying edit troubleshooting doesn t work on infinix hot 9 hoping for its inclusion on troubleshooting sites edit i can t find any forums i am hoping for more improvements in the future i ll be reinstalling the app after the update,4,2020-10-23 05:13:15,3,"Hi, if you couldn't find instructions for Infinix on those links, we also recommend asking in Infinix user forums. It's probable that other users have published the specific steps for Infinix there."
it s great but i would like to have an easier way of delaying my daily routine sometimes i wake up 1hr late so i have to go over the tasks one by one to delay each one 1hr for example if i could delay the hole routine at once would be much better the same if i want to start the routine 1hr before than planned also adding a pomodoro timer for some tasks would make this app perfect,4,2020-10-22 10:39:37,0,"Hi! Thank you very much for your suggestions 👍 We'd like to add the ability to delay or advance your schedule for the day in future versions 🙂 In any case, the app is still evolving and we'll add more improvements progressively."
why i cant set the clock in new activity there is no ok button and everytime im back the clock back to 12 am well ok button is invisible in my device,4,2020-10-21 06:23:10,0,"Hi, sorry about that. This problem only happens in some specific devices. But some users reported that it's still possible to set the time if you click on the blank space where the OK button should appear (that is, to the right of the 'Cancel' button). Please try that and let us know if that works for you."
best productivity app ever would really be useful to have a widget to display our weekly routines in a grid box really rooting for this please developer make this feature,4,2020-10-20 14:34:38,0,"Hi, thanks for your suggestion 👍 We'll evaluate the idea 🔎 Cheers! 🙂"
really enjoyed this app but was disappointed to find it doesn t automatically sync your schedule to your account i had to reset my phone and was bummed to see the schedule routines and tags i worked on for days tweaking it to fit my kid s days perfectly was gone not sure i will take the time to redo it and will probably not use the app anymore although i really did like it if you do use it just make sure you back up your schedule,4,2020-10-20 14:27:45,9,"We're really sorry about that, Andrea 😥 Our intention is to add cloud and device synchronization in future versions 👷‍♀️ For the moment, as you pointed out, users can backup their data manually here: TimeTune Settings / Backup."

You can use a routine for weekdays and another for weekends, or use a 7-day routine. If you can't find how to do it, contact us at timetuneapp@gmail.com and we'll show you 🙂"
still learning but so far seems to meet my needs,4,2020-09-26 03:54:57,0,

nice to manage time but you should work on notifications the notifications set before time appear on time of tasks and custom tunes dont work apart from these app is well made and helpful,4,2020-09-20 07:27:19,0,Hi!

this is a good app for setting up a daily routine it could be a bit more intuitive to use and i would like to have the ability to copy and paste repeat daily activities rather than to entering them one at a time but once it is set up it is very good,4,2020-09-17 14:34:03,0,"Hi Marcus! Thanks for your feedback 👍 When editing a routine you can already copy an activity or group of activities to other days if you long-click on them.

seems like a very well made app very good for if you want a rigid schedule that has plenty of options for repeating patterns one thing i would maybe look into adding would be a feature where you could set an assumed cost of an activity such as your daily lunch or dinner or maybe your commute so that you could plan your budget along with the schedule,4,2020-09-16 07:20:58,0,"Hi, thank you very much for your suggestion about the budget option 👍 We will evaluate the idea 🔎 Cheers! 🙂"
its a great app if you want a calender or routine app i really like the colour coded tags for different types of activities i would love to see a separate to do list i would prefer the to do list to be separate to the calendar or have a linking capability so that when you schedule your task into your calender it disappears or you have to choice for it to disappear from the to do list,4,2020-09-15 17:15:36,0,"Thank you very much for your suggestion, Samantha 👍 We will analyze the idea 🔎 Cheers! 🙂"
only hope we can adjust the daily routine time automatically in case we wake up late adjust just for the start time then the other activities below will adapt the time changes for developers the problem is solved thank you for the response,4,2020-09-14 19:06:19,0,"Thanks for giving more details 👍 Please click on 'Settings / Advanced / Send technical report' and mention the problem at the end of the report, so we know it comes from you.

im missing the option to archive routines and id like to remove the first already set tag so i can have events without tags aswell as events witj tags apart of that i like this app alot ive tried alot of time planning apps with routines and i like this the best so far can recommend,4,2020-08-13 17:48:39,0,Hi!

been looking for an app like this for a while i love being able to coordinate things with tags customizable by colours and icons i would happily give 5 stars apart from three things 1 it would be great if there was an option to mark tasks as completed 2 i don t see much of a difference between the time block and routine choices generally just looking for advice on this one and 3 it would be great if we could add more than 3 tags to a time block or routine,4,2020-08-05 03:55:08,0,"Hi! Routines are templates that define your day and allow you to change the configuration of the whole day on the fly by clicking a switch.

what i miss option to edit singular block from a routine e g clear or move a routine block if an event for a given day overlaps without pausing the routine otherwise great an implementation of the mentioned feature is a surefire way to make me buy pro,4,2020-08-03 16:49:57,0,Hi Simon! Thank you very much for your suggestion 👍 That's a feature we'd like to add in future versions 🙂
this app is amazing it has mostly all the nessary tools though to make this even better you can include a timer an include it on your wallpaper otherwise it is a really good app for everyone,4,2020-08-03 13:15:26,0,"Thanks for your suggestion, Sabad! 👍🙂"
hi i really enjoy and appreciate this app as a mobile app it works perfectly for me however i d really appreciate a computer version that can sync with it i m not sure if this exists already i like that the app is on my phone so that i can constantly check my schedule anywhere any time however when i feel the need to adapt and change my schedule it feels a little cluttered and time consuming i frequently feel the urge to open it up on my computer as it is easier to work with this interface given the larger screen and increased capability please consider this in future upgrades regards,4,2020-08-02 21:56:11,0,"Hi!

i want to say just add on the feature to check the box things which i have done from my daily time boxing schedule,4,2020-07-31 19:39:27,0,"Thank you very much for your suggestion, Aditya! 👍🙂"
honestly a really good app for creating routines however i d like to see a calendar view of my routines and be able to view more than the 2 weeks in the schedule tab the programmer tab is one of my favorites last thing i would like is to have activities overlap each other when creating routines instead of splitting the long activity when another activity is set to times within it,4,2020-07-30 15:47:21,0,Hi!

okay so far as i have used the app was pretty good i read that this is s new one and i like all the features present in it however there is still lot of room for improvement i have a small suggestion to make you could add a new feature that marks things to be done or followed and if not done it sets an overdue and in the end of the day it tells what are done and what are not that way people will have something that looks out for them as they follow the timetable,4,2020-07-24 15:58:52,64,"Hi!

great app but one suggestion if you could add the feature of marking whether or not we followed a particular activity in the routine that would be great like if i ve planned to study i can mark whether or not i actually studied and then it could show the statistics of how much i stuck with my routine please consider it also you could add a goal tracker love your app,4,2020-07-13 12:02:18,0,"Hi, thanks for your suggestion 👍 We will analyze the idea 🔎🙂"

new update made me little bitter in routine section kindly take it back and give the old one in the routine section first the app allowed me to edit the routine of daily easily and separately but now all the days are one by one and not side by side actually side by side is best and easy to edit thank you for your reply before it was as free but now as constant ad is placed below which is so annoying,4,2020-07-08 18:29:28,3,"Hi, sorry about the bottom ad.

one of the cleanest ui s i might have ever used i understand that the app is made for us to be able to stick to our schedules but i think it s a shame they re not letting us double it s use as a time log too i think the statistics can be made more informative like graphical representations and stuff and we should also be given an option to just log in our schedules day after day without using the routines function because i have different schedules everyday,4,2020-07-06 12:01:54,16,"Hi, thanks for your suggestion 👍 We will evaluate the idea 🔎 Cheers! 🙂"

best and cleanest scheduling app i ve found by far it has it all multiple schedules repeating on custom intervals visually effective tags comments visible on table and notifications widget statistics events dark theme all without adding unnecessary noise using it is extremely intuitive doesn t lock any significant features behind premium wall instead they re just extras that are nice to have which is a rarity but one thing that s missing is the ability to copy events activities,4,2020-06-25 08:50:46,33,"Hi, thanks for your suggestion about copying events.

i really like this app for my phone my favorite part is the voice notification it really helps with my kids homeschooling i set the voice to tell them that its time for school and to sit at the table then it plays a little song i love this because now when they hear this they turnoff their morning cartoons put their dishes in the sink grab their notebooks then sit at the table i love that i don t have to keep tell them to get to the table anymore the only thing i would suggest is having the option to make my schedule on the computer too and be able to link the two devises like how google does with their calendar app other than that i really like this app,4,2020-06-13 23:59:55,136,"Hi, thanks for your suggestions 👍 For the moment, remember that you can already transfer your data to another device manually if you make a backup on Google Drive from the source device (Settings / Backup / Backup database) and then restore the database on the target device (Settings / Backup / Restore database).

new to the app but it looks very useful based on what i ve seen thus far i m looking for an option we re saved routines can be implemented into the daily schedule but are also tied to a kind of countdown timer that corresponds to the specific routine added e g impromptu select laundry and it s automatically integrated layered onto present schedule w a countdown clock allowing for whatever amount of time you preset for that routine if it had has that then it s five stars for me,4,2020-06-02 00:07:34,11,"Thank you very much for your suggestion, Austin 👍 We will evaluate the idea 🔎"

i love how many options you have for setting notifications my fasting routine notifies me at the start 30 mins before it ends and when it ends very cool the app is missing two pretty big features though 1 the ability to see how your routines overlap right now it s completely unintuitive you basically have to do math in your head to understand your schedule 2 an indication for what the current time is again math in your head a schedule is supposed to help you visualize your time,4,2020-05-30 20:33:45,57,"Thank you very much for your feedback, Sebastian 👍 Indeed, there are some things that must be improved 👷‍♀️ In any case, the app is still evolving but we'll be adding improvements progressively 🙂"
this app was quite useful to have and something i think that i needed the only thing that put me off was the premium it slightly ruins it so i would definitely make everything accessible to everyone if i would change something about this app other than that quite handy little app that will probably make a difference to your day,4,2020-05-29 22:11:52,4,

how do you decrease the timing of the alarm my only question,4,2020-05-26 21:39:18,0,"If you choose a repetitive sound, the sound won't stop until you remove the notification. If you prefer a sound that stops by itself, we recommend to edit your notification and choose a short sound or even a custom sound from your personal storage."

this is the app i ve been looking for but there s still room for improvement first off when setting the default notification to x amount of minutes before it would make most sense to also have a notification the moment it actually happens or at least have the option to do so without having to do it manually for every single entry second there is a lack of flexibility there should be a way to easily move around and resize items on your schedule without changing the routines themselves,4,2020-05-02 19:10:45,6,Hi! Please stay tuned for changes. The app is still evolving and we'll be adding improvements progressively.
it s a great app but it would be even better if there was an option to see the whole week schedule in one place i hope you guys will add such an option in further updates,4,2020-05-01 12:27:24,0,"Hi, thanks for your suggestion 👍 The app is still evolving but we'll be adding improvements progressively 🙂"
have relied on this app for work since it 1st came out great for project management tracking budgeting time requests please bring back hourly repeat function i e set an event to repeat every 3 hours it was a useful interval timer chrome extension or online version as paid user i d pay more for this increase maximum of days for atypical routines with option to create monthly routines sync google tasks reminders in addition to events 2 way sync w google thanks,4,2020-04-30 01:59:34,8,"Hi! Thanks for your feedback 👍 We take note of your suggestions 📝 Stay tuned for changes, there will be several improvements during 2020 🙂"
so much effective app,4,2020-04-28 00:09:31,0,
it s great really been helping me keep tract of time and doing school work the only problem i m having is having a notification sound i get a notification but there s no sound and i don t notice it my sound is turned all the way up and i haven t silenced them,4,2020-04-27 23:59:00,0,"Hi! Make sure that the output channel for the sound in the app (Settings / Notifications / Output channel) is set to the volume channel you want to use (ringer, media, alarm) and that the channel is not muted. If that's not what was happening, you can contact us at timetuneapp@gmail.com and we'll find what's the cause 🙂"
i understand the function of the switch what i meant is that once i had attended to a reminder i could delete it so that i could remain with a clean slate for future use now combining events and reminders makes it hard to have a clean slate at the beginning of each day cause you can t delete recurring events i just want reminders tab that s separate from events so that i can always clean my reminders up at the end of each day and know which ones need to be done the next the app was so elaborate when events and reminders were separate functions,4,2020-04-27 10:22:14,1,Thank you very much for giving more details 👍 We remain open to all possibilities for the future 🙂
it s a nice app with a simple interface the widget is also very useful however i think it lacks a daily or weekly to do list,4,2020-04-25 12:17:51,0,"Hi, thanks for your suggestion. The project is still evolving but we'll be adding improvements progressively."
very useful app and some understandable problems with notifications,4,2020-04-24 23:08:01,0,
this app is great from a students perspective i love how you can make different schedules like one for this and one for that it s so easy and user friendly i it one thing they should add is a way that i can access this app with my schedules on both my phone and tablet without having to copy out the entire schedule again,4,2020-04-23 14:43:36,7,"Hi, thanks for your suggestion. For the moment, remember that you can easily transfer your data to another device with our backup option, like this: 1) On the source device, save a backup file on Google Drive, and 2) On the target device, restore that file from Google Drive 🙂"
this app is super useful to keep me scheduled i only have the free version but it s still really useful i like how it looks and how i can look at how much time i put into certain activities i also like how i can set multiple notifications for the same activity you can also change each individual notification however you want the app is very user friendly i would definitely recommend,4,2020-04-21 22:43:55,8,
i want to make a weekly habit routine but there s not any option to choose the name of the week s and plan please add that option instead of day 1 day 2 add sunday monday and a option to choose first day of the week thanks,4,2020-04-21 12:01:56,0,"Hi! For the moment, we recommend to create a 7-day routine if you want to see the days of the week inside the routine. But our intention is to add more flexible features in coming versions."
it s really a good app to track your daily routine and set reminders but i will be more satisfied if it gets upgrade to a more better look and more tracking options,4,2020-04-20 21:44:41,0,"Hi, thanks for your feedback 👍 Please stay tuned for updates, the app is still evolving but we'll be adding improvements progressively 🙂"
simple and nice can add up little more,4,2020-04-20 19:13:31,0,
i miss the old lay out of lines instead of squares on the daily calendar now it feels like google calendar wish they gave the option of choosing the display layout,4,2020-04-18 05:11:12,0,"Hi, thanks for your feedback 👍 We're open to all possibilities for the future."
update it would make more sense to have the schedule tab as just the schedule layed out where you have the time of day scale to the left editable show just hours or hours and minutes and then the activity from the routine s at the correct time and the only way to edit the routine could be only through the routine tab as thats where i assume you want the main part to edit routines to be but i love how you can save different routines for each day not to sure what programmer is for,4,2020-04-16 04:23:35,6,"Thanks for giving more details 👍 We're open to all possibilities for the future. About the programmer, it allows to tell the app to enable a routine(s) on a specific date (thus avoiding the need to do it manually when the date arrives)."
very nice app i liked it,4,2020-04-15 17:51:36,0,
this app for students are xawesome but the thing i don t like is that there is no tracker i can t see the what i did in the last week other wise the various options for alarm and the stickers are perfect,4,2020-04-15 17:46:00,0,Hi! Our intention is to add tracking features in the future. The project is still evolving and we'll be adding improvements progressively 🙂
nice app but online synchronization and cloud connection is required in case we miss the phone its very important today,4,2020-04-11 10:41:08,0,"Thanks for your suggsetion, Asim 👍 For the moment, we recommend to save your data in Google Drive to prevent accidental losses: TimeTune Settings / Backup / backup your database in Google Drive."
it is very helpful app,4,2020-04-08 13:51:26,0,
this apps quite easy to use and looks simple just it doesn t really meet my requirements it can be better if it got the calendar and tickbox i ve purchased it but it still like the same it said sync to my calendar but it didn t shows what i ve planned in my google calendar the only thing i am satisfield is the notification sounds,4,2020-04-05 20:23:27,3,"Hi, thanks for your suggestions 👍 The app is still evolving and we'll be adding improvements progressively 👷‍♀️ Please check the following link for a solution to the calendar issue: https://timetune.help/en/troubleshooting/#calendar  (if that doesn't work, you can contact us at timetuneapp@gmail.com and we'll find the reason) 🙂"

i think the app really helps you stay organized it really helped me out the only complaint i have it that you have to pay for the premium version but i mean how else are you supposed to be able to make money off of an app so,4,2020-04-05 08:28:25,0,Hi! Remember that none of the premium features is essential. You can create as many routines and events as you need for free 🙂

Could you give us an example? (if you prefer it, you can contact us at timetuneapp@gmail.com for better communication). Thanks! 🙂"

a great app but it would be nice to add a feature to plan a schedule for tomorrow any further date on the day before making a schedule the night before for next day is a hassle it keeps reverting back to routines and the current day everytime pressing schedule and swiping to change date is time consuming to add blocks,5,2020-09-30 08:39:47,0,"Hi, stay tuned for changes 🙂 That's something we'd like to address in future updates."

after trying a lot of time blocking apps to do lists i hav came down to this app its very convenient,5,2020-09-08 22:18:16,0,
great app but i d like to make a suggestion have an option to set the default day on custom routines to day 1 when activated it currently defaults to which ever day you closed the app and as such some of my alarms don t go off because they are on day 1 and the routine gas started on day 2,5,2020-09-08 02:53:08,0,"Thanks for your feedback, Rob. That's something we'd like to address in future releases. Meanwhile, remember that you can change the current day for atypical routines here 👉 Main menu / Routines / click on the three little dots on the bottom right of the routine card / Change current day."
it really helps if you are trying to build a system routine using the routine feature wich can be applied and customised in the schedule section it would be cool if u can add an infinite sub sub tasks thanks developers great job,5,2020-09-08 02:07:06,0,"Thanks for your suggestion, Ayman! 👍😊"

this app helps you edit your routine anytime as per one flexible time this is very useful for people like me who find it difficult to follow a routine but helps us to be on track and guides us to know what to do next you can alot time at irregular basis eg a task can be for 20 mins whereas the other could be for 90 mins the notification are at par and do good job at reminding us our next task the information that one needs to fill in when adding a task is accurate and is easy this app is the best one and would not like to replace it with any other to use for my studies also for this reason i would be looking forward to an app for the pc s or at least a web,5,2020-09-04 17:50:00,1,Thank you very much for your feedback 👍 The app is still evolving but we'll add more improvements progressively 😊
overall i like the latest update it s perfect for making schedules i do wish the blocks had two catagories past upcoming so i don t have to scroll past old events to get to my current events i also wish blocks still had the personal icons instead of only tags,5,2020-09-04 05:14:16,0,"Hi!

i needed a simple app that i can schedule my day throughout this has a very simple interface and a very visually appealing aesthetic i love it so far what would really fit the bill even better is if i can drag and drop blocks sometimes i have to shift priorities and it messes up my schedule and i need to manually go in and change things in every block thereafter,5,2020-08-20 19:43:35,0,Hi Allen!

the app is very handy and helpful but the tag break can t be removed and it occures in every task planned that makes the good visuals unhelpful and confusing if that would work 5 stars,5,2020-08-18 02:33:19,0,"Hi Marisa! Each block needs a tag to indicate the kind of activity that's going to take place. The tag will be used in notifications and to show statistics about your time.

i did the free trial this planner does not have push notifications you can set up your events and appointments even make them reoccurring but artful agenda app will not remind you or notify you what good is a digital planner if it does not have push notifications if i am going to pay for an app it should at least have most of the features a free app has,1,2020-02-27 10:08:25,28,

edited three stars because it could use some improvements like ability to select text cut copy and paste it only gives the select all option ability to drag items on lists mobile would be good too these work fine on the web but not mobile the app is gorgeous great sync with google calendar visually pleasing but too many glitches on my end including web app things not updating making what you just typed disappear or not deleting when you try to delete may retry in future,3,2020-10-20 01:45:33,3,

i am currently in the free trial period i have been in constant contact with tech support as my calenders wont sync technology support have been wonderful but too difficult for me to sort out with the time differences the app on the mobile is slow to update changes i love the colours and writing but functionally it is a bit sluggish for the price i am still considering continuing once the trial is over but not sure,3,2020-07-03 03:39:48,5,"Hi Patrice! This is Katy, the creator of Artful Agenda. If you are still having trouble, please email me at hello@artfulagenda.com - I'd love to personally make sure you are able to sync things well."
i d give it a 5 if it had some additional features like the ability to search your notes by hashtags or keywords also it works with my note 8 but writing on the screen is a little clunky it could be easier to write on screen,3,2020-06-19 02:58:33,2,Hi Natalie! We would love to have you in our Artfully Obsessed group on Facebook where you can follow along with our development process. A search function is in the plan as is better stylus capability.
so far i love the layout and look i m not giving it 5 yet but will update as i use it more i don t like that if i click on my notification that it opens the event to save or delete i stead of just looking at it or giving me the option to complete my other issue is not being able to change the time i want an all day reminder again i love it so far but would like to see that changed,3,2020-06-09 23:30:03,6,Thank you so much for your feedback!

it needs the ability to put stickers on the priorities and tasks also needs push notifications for reminders of events it s essentially just a pretty google calendar with less customization and automatic features,3,2020-05-19 21:40:04,2,"Hi Cayli!

i m really glad someone is making an app like this but it feels like a very early version and it makes more sense to have a kickstarter instead of subscription if you need the cash for primary development loads more customization is needed including a allowing uploads for your own artwork for cover theme b ability to add delete the modules you need delete at least i don t track water so it s a waste for me and c landscape mode i plan to follow development though and good luck,3,2020-04-24 09:41:05,10,"Hi Lauren!

downloaded it because i love that it has a weekly monthly and daily goal views also lists and water intake goals but it doesn t have push notifications and it seems like i can t cross off events only goals or tasks and that s a huge deal at least for me so it would be great if you guys can make that happen,3,2020-04-08 04:20:46,3,
it would be good if it was a free app i understand in app purchases but only if the app itself was free,3,2020-02-23 07:07:52,2,
i just got this app about 2 days ago i love it i would give it if the developers added new features such as more affordable 20 year more stickers love variety journaling pages customizable to be added anywhere within the planner fully customizable upcoming event pages to help plan for weddings anniversaries birthdays graduations parent to be planning baby or adopted child showers valentine s marriage proposal,3,2020-02-16 16:40:42,6,
great concept the idea of this is great but theres a couple things that need work and i have a few ideas app is very slow or laggy sometimes it wont let me click on the sugested address also would be useful to be able to click address in planner and pull up directions in google map i would also like to be able to link a list to a event and or address would also like to be able to build my desired layout more themes and stickers,3,2020-02-08 20:54:53,7,

i just downloaded this app and already love it the themes and fonts are so cute and the modules for lists is amazing i am pleased with the agenda and monthly widget options for my android as i like to use one full screen on my phone for a monthly calendar widget view it is disappointing however that stickers aren t visible on the widget view the stickers allow me to identify categories of events quickly and clearly and without them it just looks like google calendar,4,2020-09-13 19:08:02,6,
amazing agenda except that it doesn t have a habit tracker included if it did it would of been perfect,4,2020-09-09 09:20:07,0,

updating to 4 stars because push notifications are now live not fully developed this app could be great but in their rush to put it out the features are highly lacking no push notifications you cannot upload stickers no widget pretty buggy i really liked the idea of it but it needs improvement i will update to 5 stars if and when these features are added they did reach out to me to resolve my issues so i am updating to three stars,4,2020-05-13 20:58:11,4,

is it true that non premium version soon will loose any way for backup restore or transfer to another phone if not true please point to me what is the backup restore way that stays in app in the future thanks a lot if true that is really bad news backup is a basic necessity so non premium version will become practically useless on the long term in addition premium costs twice as much for a single year than let s say osmand for eternity and that is a much more complex app the free version is completely usable within reasonable limits tasks is a really nice app except that swichingt between sublists lists is unreasonably slow with some unique and essential features but this wracks it it will drive me away possibly others too not a fair move to reduce base functionality like that response to steven nottage s response that is fair enough except for one important detail all the people using your free app are now forced to decide if they want to have a meaningful app to pay or search for another app premium app should only add features and not restrict free app s capabilities if you add worthwhile features with a fair pricing people will buy it lots of people spent time to set up their tasking system because the app had the right properties for them now it looks like they were lured into using the app and then forcing them to pay i payed for a number of apps all cheaper than yours btw and actually my plan was to pay donate as soon as the slowness of switching between task lists disappear because i thought the app is really useful and it deserves support this change is different i do not mean you should not ask for payment for cloud backup etc just that you should not remove the free local backup or any other feature or that you should have omitted it from the free version from the start best wishes response to steven nottage s second response actually you can clearly see from my review that i do not want everything for free my problem is different if we could not understand each other so far perhaps it s not worth trying any more so i won t comment on the rest of your answer all the best,3,2020-03-13 18:06:09,1,"Sándor, I understand you just want everything for free & don't want to show my little app any support.

application is beautiful you can find the most common features of tasks todo list include repeat task notification alarm subtasks real i like it after try more than 4 or 5 apps but i have some improvement wish to take in consideration app design is not reach it can be more awesome or using material design second integration with online web view or sync with google account to view edit my tasks from browser may be it s paid if that at least open view for tasks for normal users thanks and keep the good progress,4,2020-10-18 09:44:18,1,"Hi Ahmed, this is already available.

excellent app it seems to be upgraded quite often i haven t had any issues with this app at all and i have been using it for about 3 yrs importing exporting is a breeze it s a great app with a great dev team keeping it up to date thank you update october 25 2020 as you can tell from my previous review i was quite satisfied with this calendar but since the changes to the interface it s nothing but garbage i will be contacting the developer about these changes today see what happens,2,2020-10-26 05:22:07,0,There were no changes in the interface of the app. Can you elaborate on your issues as they are clearly not related to the app's design?
generally it s satisfactory calendar app variety of features with clean and productive design the only problem is the support recently there are ads quite frequently popping up in the app when i wanted to upgrade to pro app shows some technical issue on their side i tried to contact support but answer was general and didn t solve the problem at all,2,2020-10-25 02:42:50,0,"Hi, please note, that we as developers are not responsible for the purchase.

long time paid user who is very disappointed with the current version i have had several events and tasks disappear as if they were never created i have had this happen for months now and have done multiple tests to see if i am at fault however this issue happens at random i have had events refresh then they are gone nowhere to be seen again ye the quick text will pop up when i attempted to make a new event with the same title so it was entered in but nothing showing same with tasks,2,2020-10-24 23:55:32,0,"Hi, how do you add those entries? Do you sync? Do you always have a stable internet connection?"
it s been more than a year since i ve requested a simple feature of counting the number of hours for certain entries in a month but there s nothing yet developers responded saying it s not a high priority because people haven t voted on it but what they don t understand is that not everyone is going to put the time to go to their website and vote on ideas but that doesn t mean those ideas suggestions aren t important,2,2020-10-20 20:19:06,0,"Please consider, that we are not able to built in every single feature requested.

took more than 3 years but they ve finally managed to get bc2 to a similar perhaps even better level than the original 3 10 2019 update unfortunately usability is severely compromised busy calendars are almost unreadable unless in day view tap to create appointment can drop you in very strange time slots 10 05 or 14 40 clock to set times is backward step from bc1 which is by far the best way to set times on a calendar i like the auto link to contacts in bc2 2 line favorites bar pls,2,2020-07-27 12:22:33,11,Please consider that BC 1 and BC 2 are two separate apps with different codes and should be treated so (also in rating).

ads are becoming really invasive and you have to wait at least 5s each time before you can skip see another ad then come back to the calendar not inclined to buy pro with such bad user experience edit and most people use a calendar app once or twice a day so i guess dev are aiming for maximum ad visibility i know nothing is free but this is annoying and it s video ads for silly games i guess i ll uninstall soon,2,2020-07-07 16:14:51,0,"The free version is still functional as the skippable ads appear only ONCE every 18 hours!

i have to agree that the full screen time draining ads are not viable for a business calendar regardless of the reasoning behind it by all means keep the small rolling ads along the bottom of the screen or alternatively charge a more reasonable fee to go pro 6 is not an option when there are so many other options out there such as acal which i used to use before bc and am now reverting to i ll keep an eye on business calendar though because if you change the ad situation or make the pro price more reasonable i ll certainly be back,2,2020-02-13 14:42:12,9,"Note that the free version is not ad-free.

very nice app with a bad drawback today s repetition for a recurring task will not appear unless i mark yesterday s task as done here s how this is very bad for me i have many recurring daily tasks and it s a very tedious job to mark all my recurring tasks as done even those that were not done it gets much worse if i don t use the app for a few days then i have to mark all recurring tasks as done for every and each previous day the app forces me to record false information a task that was not done on a specific day should stay there as not done and the recurring task should be generated for the following day you have only 3 options for a recurring task 1 to mark it as done in order for it to appear on the following day 2 not to mark it as done and it will never recur 3 to delete and it disappears and naturally it will never recur a recurring task should recur regardless of marking or not marking the previous repetition as done,2,2018-12-01 08:10:34,1,"Hi, feel free to post your suggestions in our user forum

it used to be a great app but since you took away ability to change delete a single event in a series of the recurring events it s not good for me any more,2,2018-11-07 22:35:09,1,"Hi, it is possible: https://appgenix.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/359224-i-would-like-to-edit-or-delete-a-single-event-of-a"
checked out this app in my quest to find a good solution for combining calendar events and tasks into a single scrollable homescreen widget unfortunately although the app has the option to repeat a task from the completion date the functionality is broken for example i scheduled my test task on a tuesday and set it to repeat every week from the completion date the app forced there to be a day of the week listed in the repeat schedule so that it would say something like repeat weekly on thursday on completion date now having a day of the week and also from completion date makes no sense so i was curious what the app would do i set my tuesday task to repeat every thursday from completion date and checked it off on a sunday the app should have rescheduled the task for the following sunday but it didn t it scheduled it for the following tuesday and completely ignored the thursday and the from completion date sorry business calendar 2 but that s just not going to work,2,2018-10-28 17:45:55,1,"Hi, was the task overdue already or did you check it before the due date?"

this app has been mostly great however in the last couple months the widget has stopped working sometimes i wake up in the morning or check my calendar in the middle of the day and it says it s the previous day and none of the buttons will work the only thing i can do is restart my phone one plus 5 edit i am using stock launcher and i have changed battery optimization to off we shall see if that fixes it thank you for the reply,3,2020-10-24 20:22:44,1,"Hi, have you already checked the system settings?

i ve used this pro version for years and it does everything i want including syncing well with multiple outlook and exchange calendars my only gripe is that if i need to make entries or edits to multiple appointments or events the app freezes after a few entries and i either have to wait for several minutes even if i kill the app or reboot to get the calendar back i ve learned to live with it but would give 5 stars if this was fixed,3,2020-10-19 09:49:43,10,

the app is good however i am annoyed with the way it searches for keywords in a appointment there seems to be a random way it does this by searching from a particular date going backwards and then a particular date going forward for which i have no control over all i want to do is search within the current month for a keyword that should be simple to find if i can tell it or set it to search the current month as opposed to random before and after time that the app determines,3,2020-09-28 23:12:27,9,

good has what you need from a calendar however ads are far too frequent and some ads that you show contain jumpscares which makes me uncomfortable using the app i know ads are not in your control but 5 99 is far too expensive to pay for what the pro version actually offers i think more people would be happy to pay if it was 2 99 i like this app but unfortunately will have to delete it for this reason,3,2020-06-09 04:44:13,11,"The free version is still functional as the skippable ads appear only ONCE every 18 hours!

i have been happy for the most part with this app however there s a really terrible feature that has been causing me problems every time i try to set a new event it seems that the app is trying to predict what time i want to go in the end time based on what i put in the begin time and vice versa so i get into this stupid loop of having to change both the start and end time several times each in order to get it where i want it it seems like it is potentially tied to the am pm buttons,3,2020-06-05 09:06:38,5,"Hi, this depends on the duration standard setting for you new events.

this is a fantastic app i paid for the pro version after trying for a few weeks the features are just about right for me i switched from another paid app that i ve been using for over 10 years 4 stars because 1 colors set manually for events tasks do not carry across devices 2 minimum task synch time you can set is one hour,4,2020-09-27 12:37:49,14,
love it wanted an app to combine apts tasks from google with good widgets does that more,4,2020-09-24 18:23:45,0,
it s really good would get 5th star if it was possible to refresh the widget at set intervals also manual refresh of the widget doesn t work have to open the app to sync,4,2020-09-24 18:09:19,0,
it would be greater if it can show also google reminders integrated,4,2020-09-24 13:38:02,0,"Hi, which widget do you use? Maybe we could help you set it up?"

perfect except for 1 thing the app is great for syncing and task organization etc except for a persistent reminder option some apps like bz pro have the option where you can click on the reminder in the status bar to read it or accidentally touch it but the reminder won t disappear from the status bar until the user pushes a button to actively dismiss it there is an ongoing notification on this app but the upper limit is only 2 hours after a timed task it would be 5 stars but for this,4,2020-09-21 22:22:19,0,What do you mean by that? Is your reminder disappearing from the status bar?

helpful and useful however the app has a glaring feature omission it lacks the capability to create an event with multiple reminders that s the reason why i didn t give the app five stars,4,2020-09-13 09:25:45,0,
best of the rest and i ve tried most all of them simple yet elegant interface with lots of customization options update it s been nearly two years and i still think this is the best calendar app for me,4,2020-09-10 19:03:48,0,

confirming my previous 4 star rating on the whole excellent can be confusing in some views but that only needs some familiarity to cope with,4,2020-09-09 15:14:45,0,
so so close to perfect just not quite it needs three things to get five stars from me 1 tasks should be sortable by multiple criteria so that i can order them by date and then by priority for instance 2 tasks should be nestable with sub sub sub sub etc tasks 3 it should not need access to google calendar if there is a local calendar it should be optional not mandatory the rest of you stop whining about the free version if you want to complain buy it first,4,2020-09-09 10:21:19,0,
i really like this app but it has some weird issues set as a widget it ll list multiple events on the same day example 3 or 4 entries as independence day no way to delete them not linked to multi accounts shows all no matter what very frustrating other than that it s good for quick calendar entries that s why it s staying edit going to settings appearance filter duplicate events gets rid of them just don t have muliltiple exact same entries on the same date 4 now,4,2020-09-09 03:40:58,1,"Hi, this is probably a sync issue not caused by the app. Try removing and re-adding the affected account in the android settings.

the calendar should be able to set up recurring events easier updated the calendar still makes it difficult to define a recurring date that occurs on the 3rd monday 1st thursday etc it should be more intuitive also it should allow you to define the event type better instead of just birthdays anniversaries etc a custom event type that is user defined would be nice like job anniversary named day national bbq day etc how do you import a list of holidays from a file html txt xml,4,2020-07-31 04:37:01,0,"Hi, you can set such recurrence without any problems.

i like that it keeps more than a years worth of data for the most part it is easy to use the main complaint is having to struggle past ads fairly often the good thing is that they don t last long ads are always irritating it never used to lock the screen with ads,4,2020-07-22 03:16:20,3,
it has been working well with the exception of syncing i have to manually do that once a or more,4,2020-07-20 11:06:40,0,"Hi, what is the widget that you use? What is your launcher? What happens precisely with the widget?"

i love this app but have one major disappointment when i input something in the calendar that lasts more than one day it doesn t show a solid bar of colour from day 1 last day usually at least the first or last day or both show up as a separate event it is very annoying and confusing,4,2020-07-17 11:34:37,0,"Hi, in BC 2 we differentiate between all-day events (background in the color of the calendar/event color) and events with start and end time (font in calendar color). You can spot right away which event is which. This is the element of the app's design :)"
really good calendar app i like that they have now added a larger range of colours they took away a feature i used and i don t use everything available but it s easy to use and i m keeping it,4,2020-07-16 22:24:53,0,

i ve been using the pro version for ages but it s been very disappointing with the function to make edits to an individual event that i ve created as part of a recurring series taken away if i want to edit it just to cancel or change the time for that 1 event i m given only 2 options you can either change that particular event as well as all future events in that series or all events in the series it s frustrating and time consuming to delete create the series again for just that 1 edit,4,2020-07-04 18:26:31,23,

very good app helps me keep organized and does not let me forget anything also syncs with the google account so i don t miss any dates i would only suggest that they change all the tasks paid options to the free app so we could have the opportunity to compartimentalize the complex tasks in projects and also to repeat the tasks daily or weekly to achieve milestones and to track them this app would become exceptional and dependable thank you i know you will ponder my suggestion,4,2020-06-02 20:07:23,4,

i like how it works though one massive thing i can t either figure out how to do which is more likely the case or you just don t have a repeat of the same event without having scheduled it 6 separate times in one day like eat 6 times a day supplements 8 times i think you get it other then that it s perfect for work quick and easy for me to keep my clients in there own lane and me on time,4,2020-05-22 11:49:28,0,
lowered to 4 stars because still can not use caldav to sync tasks so they are only on the phone don t break the phone or you can use google tasks if that s enough for you otherwise it s very good i m moving away from google and this does do calendars via caldav use davx5 to sync,4,2020-05-21 16:15:43,3,

sync issues here s how to fix it on samsung galaxy products tablets phones etc you will need both google calendar app and samsung calendar check both of these to make sure they are syncing google calendar and samsung calendar will over ride business calendar but it appears data is taken from samsung calendar for bc2 pro and samsung calendar takes data from google calendar so make sure all are synced lol ya its a lot of work sometimes they are functioning fine but this will help you if they don t cooperate don t be upset with the developers of bc2 pro they don t have a say in the matter as these big companies have big ego s and bc2 pro can t do much about it except this bc2 pro if you are reading this please create your own calendar system to sync accross platforms so we don t have to rely on google calendar and samsung lets just stay within the bc2 platform i will happily ditch google calendar forever if you make this happen you guys rock cheers,5,2020-10-12 07:06:21,0,

great app the free version offers all the features i need and more integration with google calendars is seemless and i rarely have issues with the app i m not a fan of the new ad format but i admit it was short sighted of me to initially give a 3 star rating because of that i am changing it now to 5 stars because this is still by far the best calendar app i ve used,5,2020-10-10 00:59:27,29,"Hi, we avoided this solution for as long as it was possible.

the app opens it self up whenever it wants to display an ad but the screen remains the same but i cant press anything so it just opens up in the background all day long to display ads and make money when im not even using the app this feature is ridiculous and it started happening every 5 minutes as opposed to every now and then so i just deleted the app,1,2019-07-06 22:10:36,3,
i have used this app for years i have always paid for the premium version at first it was my favorite app but it has gotten steadily worse now it is very glitchy it closes randomly and typically takes up to three minutes to open which is very embarrassing when i m trying to set an appointment with a customer it also randomly unchecks completed tasks and reverts to older versions of my schedule the developers are uncaring and blame my phone note 8 i m looking for a new app,1,2019-07-03 17:49:29,17,

a negative experience i wasn t using it and forgot about it until it was renewing i didn t port it over to a new phone and it seems you can t cancel the app except through the app this means i would have to install it on my new phone give it permission to access my information then cancel the subscription and uninstall it other apps on my phone with subscriptions i can cancel through google play apparently not this one,1,2018-09-04 22:31:59,10,

used the pro version for a couple months as it seemed like a good app randomly deletes and duplicates events and unable to customise when events are recurring if they aren t one day after another you have to manually enter them all uninstalled,2,2020-08-09 18:51:02,1,
they are always changing something after updates and it isn t always functional like used to be,2,2020-07-10 14:21:11,0,

this new planner pro for which i paid for life is poorer than the previous version i take ages to open does not immediatly delete bring not all old tasks forward very bad,2,2020-06-19 12:26:20,1,
i downloaded this app on my photo and it works great but i just downloaded on my tablet for school and even though i used the same account none of my events were there it didnt sync right i tried to restart nothing this app is good just not for multiple devices,2,2020-06-04 02:56:09,0,
this app was fine for years and then became extremely laggy it also started duplicating weekly tasks to the point that i would have to delete five or six versions of a task in order to return it to one weekly often the delete or complete options have to be used multiple times on the same task before it actually disappears i have basically stopped using it except as a calendar but it s so slow it s not even efficient to be used for that,2,2020-05-12 01:02:27,27,
great app but it forces you to sign in to something to use it which is garbage you should be able to use this without signing in backup and restore doesn t have to be via online accounts only it can be export to file thing which i preffer 100 of the time,2,2020-04-29 07:59:10,0,

it is doing a strange black screen thing and randomly opens by itself other reviews have mentioned this and i suspect it is making my phone crash my phone is crashing several times a day when i remove the app it stops crashing i hope there is a fix for this it works just fine on my tablet but not my phone it s a great app due to its simplicity i switched to another planner app today and will be requesting a refund,2,2019-05-14 20:49:10,4,

i was told to install planner pro instead of planner plus which was what i already used in order for my cell phone ipad to sync i have had at least 5 emails back forth with the contact person but i still can t get my calendars linked using my email address as instructed i guess i will have to go back to my google calendar i love the planner plus but need a calendar that syncs to both my cell and ipad,2,2019-02-04 07:29:48,2,
eh it s mediocre and really doesn t do anything your calendar app on your phone doesn t already do i liked using the month widget until it just decided on jan 29 that the month of february no loger existed i tried to look ahead to the month of feb to see a preview from the widget but it kept going fron jan to march the only way to view feb in the widget was to change the date to feb in my phone just went back to my phone s calendar app uninstalling,2,2019-01-30 11:10:53,7,
after reinstall data not recover while take backup google drive,2,2019-01-20 14:02:31,0,
the interface is great and i love it overall however i m giving it two stars because it won t synchronize between my samsung phone and ipad despite being the same account information for each i emailed their support like about this and they asked for my login info but i never heard anything back this is a huge inconvenience because i put a lot into the version on my ipad and i dont and wont do it twice for the same application once this is fixed i ll happily increase the rating,2,2019-01-18 22:25:34,68,
i would love it if my calendar would sync across by devices and my tasks notes synced its disappointing because i enjoy the simplicity of the format its user friendly but iy doesn t work for me since i can t sync all devices,2,2018-12-31 23:48:12,1,
i loved this planner for several years with no issues all of a sudden i can t launch the app or create edit an event without getting a noisy intrusive pop up ads i will be looking for a new option possibly even just my stock calendar,2,2018-12-17 09:24:21,5,
i have been using this for a while and found it to suit my needs well i wanted something where i could see trasks and appointments in a daily view this accomplished that goal in an easy to read and navigate format however there must have been a recent update that has made the ads ridiculously invasive to the point that i no longer want to use this app i think i will start checking on alternate options,2,2018-12-12 21:29:15,33,
free version does not allow you to view all your events in the monthly view i only see colored dots that indicate an event is scheduled i would like to see the event names i contacted support but sadly did not get a response,2,2018-11-04 03:42:02,4,

i ve had this app for a few years and it worked well until the last several months it s gotten increasingly buggy and will do things like forget you checked off tasks as completed and re list them as incomplete between closing and re opening the app it also had been freezing more and more frequently to the point where that happens at least once a day and now i can t even load certain screens because of this i will not be renewing my subscription this year and will be using another app,2,2018-07-28 22:20:13,3,
not what i was looking for i saw there was a time it would remind me i thought it would work but non of them did so that sucked,2,2018-07-13 11:23:02,0,

this app was amazing when i first started using it now it duplicates tasks too much i have about 20 of the same task for each day and it takes forever for me to delete the extra tasks,2,2018-05-30 19:04:04,2,
i made several repeating tasks that are supposed to be repeated weekly by the day of the week they seem to just multiply and now the same 4 tasks will show up 3 times each on a single day i can t edit the original repeating ones i can only delete them individually on the day they show up several times this is very annoying this app was a waste of my money i paid for the ability to make repeating tasks i m very disappointed,2,2018-04-04 23:01:47,60,
was fine until the last couple of days when the layout turned squirrelly on my android tablet seems okay on my smart phone still i will not purchase full version unless the version for my tablet goes back to matching the screen layout on my cell,2,2018-03-29 08:04:04,22,

it s ok the free version does the same thing your calender does on your phone,2,2018-02-26 03:11:54,0,
with so many free calendar apps out there there s just nothing in the free version of this one to make you choose it the only feature that might set it apart from the competition is the project feature but you have to pay to use it sure you have the notes feature but there are ways to accomplish the same thing in pretty much any other calendar so i just can t see the point rather than pay for an upgrade to an app that s just ho hum the view isn t even very customizable i ll be uninstalling,2,2018-02-18 21:01:47,0,

i have questions that i would like to have answered and i have emailed numerous times with no reponse back they say dont write negative reponses to this app without contacting us first i did email for answers but no one will answer my questions my questions are not bad for this app but the people behind this app are terrible business people so this could be a great app but service is terrible which instead of getting 4 or 5 stars im giving 2 should be 1 but app is good the ones behind the app are bad just want to take peoples money and then laugh at us by not helping,2,2018-01-17 01:29:25,1,
didn t get past not being able to use it in portrait mode i think i should be able to choose whether i need widespread view as in a spreadsheet or a portrait view to view a page of writing and this does not give me the option i may end up using it this is only the second app that i have tried for organizing by used to be hand ink written notebooks,2,2018-01-07 06:23:46,4,

i really wanted to like this app but it s just too buggy sometimes i open the app and it doesn t have the icons to switch views also the 12 hour formatting is really flawed and the priority scale seems way too complex high medium low should be enough for most people,2,2017-12-22 12:48:27,7,

app is very buggy week view is completely unusable shows some events twice and some not at all also it would be nice if there was an option in month view to see the names of the events without having to click on every day individually fix this and you ll get 5 stars but without that especially week view the app is useless,2,2017-10-30 13:02:17,0,
isn t thanksgiving and christmas considered a holiday am i wrong,2,2017-10-19 05:34:34,1,
widget is buggy a task marked as completed in the app is displayed as overdue and trying to tick it off in the widget takes me into edit mode the proper app when reopened shows a blank inbox and revisiting the screen is required to populate it again poor punctuation eg 28 sep 2017 why the space before the comma is not that big a deal but also adds to the app not feeling very pro,2,2017-10-17 22:36:19,96,

i paid for the pro version because the color coding in the free version didn t work properly come to find out that the pro version doesn t have daily tabs for tasks and notes as the free version does but the paid version does color code gaining that feature isn t worth losing the other two i feel robbed,2,2017-07-11 01:33:53,0,

the single franklincovey planner feature available is the task abc123 priorities system but oddly the task status system is missing no more fc system functionality as of the rest it s a very conventional pim suite with a little of crm salt pepper,2,2017-04-02 21:22:53,9,
well based on the description of this app and what i understood i would receive has not lived up to its description i hope the bugs will be worked out i emailed for help more than 24 hours ago and have not received any response thus far it would be helpful to have a help and or faq section to refer to after only one day of using the app i have encountered the following 1 from calendar screen button does not give option for project only event task or note i have the upgraded version 2 settings general start with is set for day view but shows month instead 3 help feedback only gives option to email for help no option to search for help 4 when deleting an item in a series comma i do not get the option to just delete the one occurrence am i doing something wrong is there any help that i can expect to receive i paid 4 99 for the upgraded version and i am not at all happy busy people with crazy schedules need a reliable app,2,2017-03-29 09:12:08,42,
i think the free version of the app has some good capabilities but lacks some functionality that i desire functionality that i m not sure exists in the paid version due to the lack of support for the product i was unable to find where i could go to ask questions thus the 2 star rating,2,2017-03-27 10:08:55,107,
it doesn t work well as a calander or any type of memo for me i also didn t like the type of layout design they made it didn t fit with what the purpose of this app was said to do,2,2017-03-26 18:02:55,25,
used to love this app but after the update it s dumb and no longer useful,2,2017-03-25 17:06:34,16,
the app does not sync with my google calendar and there is no sync option or refresh option meetings etc are not shown and i have to go back to the google calendar or acalender to make sure i don t miss anything events made on my tablet do not show on my phone please fix this it s such a great app if it just worked,2,2017-03-16 13:46:04,14,

very easy to pull me in i should have stopped but hindsight is always 20 20 my friends and people who are interested in google apps for integrated coordination of tasks meetings whatever but what really gets my blood boiling and made me downgraded from 3 stars to 2 stars is the deadweight loss of not being able to either donate the rest of the subscription source capital investment that is just raining still if someone makes to make a donation is that i m still sitting here with this deadweight loss,2,2016-12-15 03:03:40,0,

this app was everything i needed i loved it but after thenlast update i cannot log in to my account so i cannot see my daily schedule will not trust it again and i have already unistalled it i need an organizing app which i can trust fortunately all the events were synced to my google calendar but notes and tasks didnt so i dont know if i am forgeting something that is pending now,2,2016-10-28 13:10:22,42,
i logged in with facebook i upgraded to the pro version checked the planner a day later and had to log in again now it says to upgrade to the pro version again and if i click it play says i m already subscribed to it,2,2016-10-28 02:28:29,1,
every time the company upgrades the app or make any changes subscribers can t access the calendar sign in page has many issues,2,2016-10-27 21:39:44,0,
i put an event in and it doubles everyday fix the glitches this is a great app otherwise,2,2016-10-18 21:00:31,4,
at first i really liked it because all the systems are functioning well in my phone but when i used this in the tab the notifications wont even turn i sm really pissed by this and i hope you fix this asap,2,2016-10-16 15:03:24,18,
would not load,2,2016-10-03 02:22:03,1,
keeps telling me my email is invalid when it s a normal gmail won t let me sign up,2,2016-09-27 20:51:49,1,
i went on thinking it was easy to put in reminders and stuff but it isn t you have to buy the full version,2,2016-09-27 16:41:01,2,
it was great before but lately it sends notifications whenever it likes it doesn t notify according to schedule anymore and now it doesn t notify at all,2,2016-09-25 04:18:06,2,
the free version comes with ads and normally i would be okay with that except that it decides to interrupt you seemingly every minute to buy the full version now when planning your day you might have to schedule time to exit out of the constant ad pop ups,2,2016-09-22 00:30:58,1,
doesn t go to portrait,2,2016-09-21 11:04:56,1,
i really did not like the fact that when i set an exact time for stuff i can not sort to according to that so if i want to plan my day 10 am i have to do a 11 am i have to do b i can not sort it by time,2,2016-09-15 13:48:00,16,
when opening this app on my tablet nexus 7 2013 my screen goes to landscape upon exiting the app the screen remains stuck in landscape only way to fix is to turn tablet off and back on,2,2016-09-12 22:38:56,0,
has potential but you gotta pay,2,2016-09-07 23:54:12,0,
i was pretty pleased with the layout and the weekly view on the paid version but then i started encountering problems first of all i used fb to sign up and i logged out of the app and i can no longer sign in it stays loading indefinitely also on the weekly view it showed the incorrect name for the day and kept changing it it also changed notifications randomly,2,2016-09-06 23:18:11,0,
paid for the pro version and itbdoesn t seem to be working properly appointments are not showing and sometimes double books contacted support took several days to get back to me and was still not helpful app is glitchy will not be renewing the subscription and going back to the old pencil and paper appointment tracking method i cannot run my business with a faulty appointment app very disappointing,2,2016-09-06 22:40:04,8,
it was perfect for a personal planner problem is i use google calender widget for business and this widget for personal what ever you select for one automatically sets for the other was kinda hoping for two different planners here,2,2016-09-06 07:08:14,0,
norton antivirus reported this as a malicious app and recommended i uninstall after paying for the pro version i felt it was very lacking no portrait mode on tablet no day mode on phone no way to adjust the length of a meeting beyond that of the default meeting settings,2,2016-09-04 20:49:45,7,
5 for daily recurring tasks no thanks,2,2016-08-24 03:21:56,0,

i m not going to create an account so uninstalled my tasks are private,2,2016-08-16 16:03:11,0,
this app worked well at first but it kept altering my entries no matter how many times i changed them not sure if it s a problem just with syncing accounts,2,2016-08-15 07:24:49,6,
the ui is not attractive to begin with text overlap and the fact that the only screen orientation available is landscape immediately turned me off to the app the layout is not bad and puts all the information right in front of you but it looks as if it was built for windows 98 i certainly was not willing to pay for the full version when the free version was so flawed i can find better free apps with more functionality than the paid version of this one it needs some work,2,2016-07-30 11:12:53,33,
i already had bought the full version and now i have to pay again which is whatever but furthermore my calendar is missing most of the appointments and recurring events that i had before i just upgraded my phone to the htc10 from the lg g5 and i have none of my important calendar events now,2,2016-07-22 12:32:05,4,"Please contact us at planner.a@appxy.com, we'll help to fix your issue."
suddenly need a subscription after i had paid for a full version and some of my calendars no longer work with the app not impressed,2,2016-07-18 02:26:59,21,"Dear Steven, please contact us at planner.a@appxy.com, we'll help to fix your issue."
i dont see the difference between this and google calender which already came with my phone,2,2016-06-27 11:03:01,0,
i found this difficult to use due to navigation love the home screen but its impossible to get back to it also the nonstop full screen ad to buy the app yearly is so annoying that alone makes it unusable if you make my free experience terrible why would i want to pay you,2,2016-06-21 08:42:45,6,
it s supposed to be able to go on multiple devices yet when i downloaded to my phone after putting it on my tablet it just keeps saying loading after i spent a lot of time setting it up and plugging in all my appointments for the next month it s a huge disapointment should i get fixed i will change rating to a 5 star,2,2016-06-21 02:25:30,1,
it does not give me the ability to not use 24 hr time format i m not in the military or a factory so i prefer regular time format doesn t matter how many times i uncheck the 24 hr setting it sticks fix that and i ll rate higher and maybe even purchase a yr subscription,2,2016-06-04 07:31:41,2,
wouldn t let me make reoccurring events without an upgrade,2,2016-06-02 07:59:48,1,
i liked the lay out for the most part except being forced into landscape mode in the app the glitch was that when adding something to the calendar a box would come up for date time but cut off the calendar and clock that s necessary to select date time there was no way to even input manually it would work great if you only had to enter something for whichever date you were on and a specific one hour period set a half an hour after the time on your device very disappointing,2,2016-05-18 14:09:51,0,
i did my update and everything i had programmed and saved on this app is gone i ve lost all important dates information and reminders for the entire year well done guys,2,2016-05-16 23:13:29,1,
this app wouldn t up date my schedule only some postings would transfer to my employees phones and i couldn t be positive something actually worked unless i checked to make sure twice i even bought the pro version not happy,2,2016-05-10 04:34:53,0,
i did like it until you updated and took the good features away lame,2,2016-05-07 06:31:38,2,
on the pictures it shows you things that are only on the paid version,2,2016-05-04 09:06:25,1,
i liked the version before the update where it had blocks to show the event that s the only reason why i downloaded it and now it got rid of it,2,2016-05-04 03:18:13,16,
changes and cancellations do not get updated on the widget secondly it is not possible to scroll between months easily,2,2016-04-29 19:54:39,7,
it just says it failed or something like that might work for you though,2,2016-04-29 04:00:09,0,
it wasn t everything i thought it would be,2,2016-04-27 01:36:51,0,
i loved this app when i tried the free version the side tabs and all it felt like a planner then i open it up and it must ve updated because the looks changed no side tabs so i paid for the pro version to get more out of it nothing has changes i go to landscape view and it won t scroll it s glitch to i have paid the 4 99 and it keeps telling me to upgrade i ve already paid i emailed you guys and still haven t heard any support a week later so my advice to you all keep your 5,2,2016-04-25 06:46:05,35,
i was happy with all the things with this app until i got up to find all my appointments were gone,2,2016-04-20 09:46:32,0,
it s buggy when going back and forth between different views switching from events to tasks etc also tasks widget doesn t work because it will show all tasks completed tasks also included i d try to check the box to mark it complete but it would bring me to edit the task monthly widget can t even be placed on my screen it says there is not enough room its a new slate i m trying to put it on,2,2016-04-19 05:54:44,1,
the app always stops i had to restart my tab to make it work or try to open so many times,2,2016-04-17 20:03:20,1,
seems to be extremely buggy couldn t work out how to use the app for what i wanted so i subscribed for more features that i would use app keeps telling me to purchase but then errors saying i m already subscribed complicated and broken if app updates then so will this review side note portrait view for tablet would be very appreciated tablet is only 7 inches and portrait is easier to type on whilst standing at work,2,2016-04-16 16:38:45,8,

good looking app but got on the company s website to see what other integrations platform downloads were available no downloads available on their site site is very sparse and lacking real support info get on their facebook and see copious complaints about everything from people being double billed to glitches on various apps they ve created the clencher for me was that they were blatantly ignoring these comments and replies and continued posting links about their apps nope uninstalling,2,2016-03-21 19:42:50,1,
has some unchangeable unfeatures like not showing appointments marked with other than default privacy as well as appointments marked as available instead of busy that s all work hours i have set apart for clients but not allocated yet important information to me,2,2016-03-15 12:53:03,0,

no way to jump ahead in month view if you need to enter an event that s two months out it s a pain to do i uninstalled it,2,2016-01-26 10:48:12,2,

works with my google calendars and has nice planner features i gave it only three stars because i cannot change my calendar colors i can change the colors in settings but the first time planner updates the calendars change back to the default colors i also paid for the original incarnation of this calendar that they abandon and went to this subscription based one the version i had eventually stopped functioning as android updated i do not trust paying for this after that experience,3,2020-08-10 03:31:23,7,
it s a great app but i wish you guys would arrange tasks based on their set time instead of be prioritizing them,3,2020-07-30 06:34:31,0,
the app has been good for showing my calendar and daily notes journal on the same screen i would like it much better if there was a backup restore option and if it was available across devices and platforms i had to reset my phone recently and lost most of my daily notes i have the pro version but will be canceling my subscription,3,2020-07-20 02:41:28,54,
use to track work things,3,2020-06-25 19:19:19,0,
i ve been using it for a while and really find it useful but it duplicates the tasks which is pretty annoying i suddenly have to exercise 6 times a day xd i guess that could be benefitial but no it s annoying really xd will be glad to give it 5 stars once that stops happening,3,2020-06-19 10:34:12,5,
really like the app however it is multiplying my tasks on a daily basis and i cant delete them as fast as they appear frustraring not using it right now,3,2020-03-21 23:24:00,24,
good app however the notification has stopped working,3,2020-03-15 20:06:42,1,
the app design looks nice and has good features this is a functional planner app i can access the week view in the free version though a prompt to upgrade to premium pops up but tasks cannot be set as recurring in the free version this is a main feature i m looking for in a planner app also the look of the app cannot be customized stuck forever with that purple at the top of the screen there are other free apps that include these things,3,2020-01-19 00:49:26,0,
i would give this app 5 stars but i am beyond frustrated with how slow it is to open i pay the subscription for premium and i love all the options in the app but it literally takes 5 to 10 minutes for the app to open unless there is a notification in my notification bar that i can open the app with this would be annoying even with a free app but to pay for a slow app that takes ages to open is ridiculous in the 2 or 3 years that i ve used it this has never been fixed with any upgrade,3,2020-01-16 19:57:45,37,
g o o d,3,2019-10-15 00:56:41,0,
this is hands down the best personal planning app i ve ever come across that being said it s basically unusable on android the view jumps to the top of the day s task list at random making it easy to accidentally check off the wrong task it takes minutes to load anything when you try to access the rest of the app through the back arrow at the top left and on occasion tasks will duplicate themselves multiple times with different parameters i use it on my ipad with no trouble at all,3,2019-10-10 19:58:54,12,
app is extremely useful just that the search feature doesn t cover all the notes in the app,3,2019-09-27 13:55:57,3,
great app intuitive navigation easy to use nice integration with other apps what s up with the lavender color designation i didn t think that lavender would look turquoise,3,2019-07-28 22:03:30,0,
useful app interface are easy to use would be better if you could add search function so we dont have to comb thru everything to find what we are looking for,3,2019-07-20 05:09:39,4,
i like how it allows me to set any number of reminders minutes hours days weeks in advance either by push notification or email but many little bugs pepper this app the calendar view will bug out and not map to the selected month from time to time the location field tries to be smart by giving you a maps like autocomplete but this is annoying when you just want gym for some reason the first letter of an event name isn t registered by autocorrect so event turns to venting,3,2019-07-18 19:23:31,1,
it s actually good but it doesn t have a feature where your task appears on your lockscreen that will remind you everytime you forgot something to do,3,2019-07-03 11:34:35,2,
does not update tasks in widget automatically,3,2019-05-21 02:21:50,3,
i need more time with your app i m looking for an organizing app to meet the needs of me and my gaming community to be able to cross schedule events share valuable information w aarach while i know that was never your vision i am impressed with the very easy to use ui but have not figured out if u can share projects notes calandars ect i cam see your app meeting a very large need in a community the desperately needs an easy way to collaborate adding a group s feature to cross plan 5 stars,3,2019-05-12 03:09:01,6,
bought the planner pro love the app the down side is that the app did not sync i have 2 device handphone and tablet both android i have to update both device twice instead of once would give 4 or 5 star if it can sync between both device i have some suggestion maybe can input some bill tracker and some cute icon or pill tracker hydration icon,3,2019-04-14 19:30:06,3,

i love this app it s the only one that looks and feels like the old franklin planner however since the latest update i have a banner ad on the bottom of the screen with google ads and i am a paid pro user this is extremely annoying if they don t remove this i m leaving,3,2019-03-24 21:07:31,83,

forever landscape why can t i ever get this app to rotate to portrait mode it s never been able to do this even after downloading it on other phones way too annoying to have to deal with for me to deem it a useful app at least for me,3,2017-08-18 20:40:40,3,
it s fairly easy to use however the alarm doesn t work,3,2017-07-28 20:54:29,0,

this app is easy to use but my biggest issue is that when i add notes or check off tasks when off line they dont save,3,2017-06-01 21:29:56,5,
i liked the app and it looked like it had a good set of features but i didn t like the 4 99 year recurring subscription fee,3,2017-05-31 17:57:05,0,
task repeat options are garbage for basic things it s ok but don t expect more than that,3,2017-05-30 09:44:22,5,
helpful but not too much,3,2017-05-22 12:34:00,0,
i liked the app well enough to pay for it so i could get my recurring items in order with it but when i set a task as recurring it only shows up on the day that i started with,3,2017-04-25 09:56:47,9,
it worked great to start with but now i m not getting task notifications and some of my events are not showing up on my calendar widget,3,2017-04-21 03:43:54,6,
i like this app very much because it s fairly easy to use and it allows for actual ring tones to be used not just notification tones however my biggest issues are that i cannot receive any notifications from the planner if the event was created on my phone s calendar i m assuming this is the issue since only half or less than half of my total events and tasks do not sound it also will not sound when i have reminders set for many different times it s original default reminder is 15 minutes before the event time but i changed it to be on time and then i would make other reminders if need be it will only sound at 15 minutes before the event time no matter what i tell it to do,3,2017-03-30 10:25:02,397,
i m using this app for work for due diligence when i first installed the app i was sure i could search my notes for key words now i can t am i doing something wrong or is that function not available on this app,3,2017-03-15 17:15:15,11,
it does not have the ending time of an event,3,2017-03-11 00:37:26,5,

no matter what i do even setting no notifications when creating event or task they continually pop up not happy with this feature,3,2017-03-03 02:03:44,5,
a good app overall but the new version no longer shows the duration of events which is extremely annoying and a deal breaker for me,3,2017-02-27 18:28:00,0,
i love the app except that the widget does not remember customizations such as default calendar not using 24 hour time if this could be more flexible and keep the settings of the apps i would definitely rate five stars it s helped save time having multiple uses for one app but i need the widget compatibility,3,2017-02-20 18:10:10,1,
the app no longer notifies me of my tasks please fix,3,2017-02-07 00:10:06,1,

i had several recurring events to keep track of my week but after the update they disappeared,3,2016-12-04 23:09:38,7,
good design but it s not exactly free if you have to pay for basic features like reoccurring events,3,2016-11-29 01:26:26,0,
i purchased the paid version and i m sort of disappointed every time i enter a task it adds the first letter of the first word over again so i have to change it each time i e it will autocorrect to eevery instead of every it is also kind of laggy it could be a great app but not as is,3,2016-11-23 00:35:10,75,
i suggest you add a deadline button instead of just tasks and events personally that s the only reason i dont use it is the classifications aren t enough,3,2016-11-20 22:57:47,0,
needed sync tasks color code events and for goodness sake speed up this is extremely slow,3,2016-11-17 02:00:13,0,
it s really unresponsive i have to tap 3 times so something opens or to check a box or anything too bad i really liked it but this is too annoying,3,2016-11-06 00:50:47,3,
the app is making me sign in to an account but won t let me sign in frustrated,3,2016-10-31 12:36:56,3,
the reviews are sending a clear message to you act on them i think the last update has messed everyone up if you don t act you re sending a message back ie you meant to mess everyone up by locking them out,3,2016-10-30 15:01:30,2,
this planner app is pretty clear and simple i have the paid version and it works ok except today they had a glitch and i lost everything even when i reinstalled it was just so screwed up so if you don t mind losing all of your work when they update i guess it s survivable,3,2016-10-29 01:47:21,6,
add ability to have a dark theme,3,2016-10-26 11:42:43,4,
troublesome widget organization when i tap a date it opens app to date previously open not new date needed very time consuming and creates booking mistakes when not careful,3,2016-10-24 22:42:39,9,
love it but it has some major flaws 1 can t personalize theme 2 can t configurate widgets toolbars what details are displayed 3 the widget s size is too wide max 4x would love it if it were more flexible 4 you cannot sort the notes on one day to be listed in alphabetical order on the day widget it will always be sorted by time 5 the app malfunctions when you place two widgets on the home screen 6 app stops working a lot for seemingly no reason,3,2016-10-23 12:26:55,1,
enjoyed it s use while it lasted uninstalled now,3,2016-10-19 04:11:49,0,
can t make calls from the app by clicking on the phone number like google calendar,3,2016-10-17 04:45:23,6,
pro version and it still won t handle the recurring tasks smoothly please fix it i ve restarted my phone several times and still nothing,3,2016-10-11 04:04:08,2,
the app would be nice and work well if it wasnt for this 1 issue but its a pretty big issue as far as daily planners go it only shows half of a clock or calender in the create event task subscreen meaning i can not select any times that would fall on the right hand side of the clock or i can not select a due by date for tasks because the right side of the calender is missing i would already own the full version if it wasnt for this problem,3,2016-10-10 10:06:30,1,
crashing a lot after update,3,2016-10-06 22:07:38,1,
уууу,3,2016-09-28 19:41:56,3,
i just got the app but i can barely use it because every time i click on something it redirects me to a page that asks me to upgrade for 4 99 yr if it would just let me use the free version i might actually like it,3,2016-09-27 07:57:02,15,
this application was exactly what i needed when i first started to use it now there are a handful or problems events are appearing twice events get deleted or not appearing at all after being saved deleting one event and the reoccurring events get deleted and not appearing on the selected reoccurring days very annoying,3,2016-09-23 00:10:17,40,
fix the widget bugs please,3,2016-09-16 22:54:06,1,
not a bad app pretty good got a few things organized with it,3,2016-09-11 07:33:12,5,
there s nothing wrong with this app although it could be slightly better but it s just like google calendar in fact it s integrated with google calendar and all your events show up in gc even the selections of colors in association to events and how you input information is the same if you re an android user go ahead and just use the built in google calendar if not your samsung htc whatever one i have near stock android so i get google same difference really,3,2016-08-30 23:32:31,0,
overall good a search feature would be great for notes thanks,3,2016-08-29 04:20:26,8,

why did you show the checkboxes in widget when you can t even check uncheck it via the widget its just so frustrating to go to the app just to check a list other than that this app is good,3,2016-06-30 04:36:41,0,
needs to give you the option of adding pictures when note taking if it had this option would be excellent otherwise not a bad app,3,2016-06-15 10:53:03,7,
i use it mainly for its widgets one thing though please fix the widgets so that the they show the current date and don t stay put on the previous day unless manually changed,3,2016-06-07 12:03:54,22,
just getting used to it but so far not bad,3,2016-05-23 10:19:29,0,

but i miss the hourly blocks made it easy to sceduale my work hours,3,2016-05-20 21:51:53,0,
it doesnt update between your calanders i need a planner that stays up to date with my calendar changes this is not it waste of money,3,2016-05-17 11:13:10,0,
it is an ok app as far as personal entries are concerned and the connected functions of name time and place can not count on it to keep you informed about set calender events though as they are set default in 2014 mothers day was on the 8th 2nd sunday in may this year not wednesday the 11th they can thank my wife for keeping me informed it is a scheduling app and if the default events are wrong as well as uneditable how confusing will your scheduling be keep an accurate calendar handy,3,2016-05-12 17:06:06,1,
why would i pay money to have recurring events in a planner i think i ll stick with my default calander app,3,2016-05-12 02:32:40,2,
love this planner but whenever i use the repeat function i cant just edit 1 event i have to edit the rest of the events that are linked together too would be great if i m able to edit jus 1 event even when im using the repeat function would also be great if there s a copy and paste of events function would make things really easier,3,2016-05-04 15:51:00,1,

could be better on samsung s6 not showing reminders on screen have to open the same as a diary,3,2016-03-23 16:00:15,2,

i prefer to use apps in portrait mode on my 7 inch phone tablet huawei mediapad x2 1920 1200 when the keyboard pops up while adding a task i can barely see what i m typing because the screen height is greatly reduced in landscape,3,2016-03-15 21:43:02,1,
i really liked it at first but it keeps turning on the alarm for my events even though i pressed no alarm i don t know how many times,3,2016-03-15 05:24:14,0,
wouldn t it be great if this app had also alerts instead of just notifications it s easy to miss a notofication also why can t we edit a specific day for a repeated event but we have to edit also all future events or nothing,3,2016-03-14 18:14:13,2,
simple feel like paper planner,4,2020-10-22 06:31:39,0,

so far it is working only just started using,4,2020-10-10 04:16:11,0,
it s ok i have this app for several years i don t like the advertisements,4,2020-10-09 18:59:37,0,
i love this app a couple of suggestions 1 for the repeat function i wish it had more flexibility such as an end date since i am a visual person i would love it if the task list had color associated with the level of importance but i do love this app so much that i upgraded,4,2020-10-06 19:12:21,15,
excellent application would ve given 5 stars if the following want such a pain would like for it to be easier to remove a recurring event however that seems to be an incredible pain otherwise i would recommend this app to everyone who is most comfortable with a realistic planner feel with a futuristic spin on it definite thumbs up,4,2020-10-02 13:12:08,2,"Hi, would you please contact us at planner.a@appxy.com? We'll help to figure it out asap."

premium user here and i m enjoying the app so far i ve had a hard time replacing an old app my poli and this one seems to fit the bill it s quite buggy at this stage and has limited features but functionality is great i can see myself using it for the next 6months 1year hopefully the devs keep improving the app,4,2020-09-29 09:23:05,22,
i like the app but the user interface could be polished the seems slightly delayed a new look would be nice but over all a helpful app would still recommend,4,2020-09-24 21:38:55,0,
really like this app wish syncing across android and ios was easier but i have looked and no other app has the style and versatility of planner pro well done planner pro folk,4,2020-09-06 07:31:04,6,
great app really needs a desktop capability,4,2020-09-02 00:07:08,0,
does it work in a laptop on the web,4,2020-08-27 21:59:11,0,

so far works great,4,2020-08-19 00:05:17,0,
i like the fact that i can put everything i need to do on the task list and it stays there forever but then i have a small widget that just shows me what i am focused on in the moment so it is not overwhelming i also like being able to prioritize my tasks in the a b and c categories it is also good to be able to sync my calendars with my family s but sometimes when i turn to the calendar it has trouble displaying the multiple appointments especially if they overlap,4,2020-08-14 01:20:43,22,
this is a decent app for keeping track events and appointments,4,2020-08-04 20:33:35,0,
the ease of use for everyday things is great i have a note pad task pad and calendar and i just set a task to call back a customer after hrs sure it might note be a flashy business planner but if you just want something to remind you of events store something quickly for later reference what more do you need so far any ads haven t been intrusive the main reason people stop using these kind of apps,4,2020-07-27 08:33:32,19,
any chance of getting a widget for the calendar love the dark mode,4,2020-07-23 05:51:18,3,
doesn t replace my default calendar but does have extra features that take it from calendar scheduler to planner great product,4,2020-07-22 23:48:15,0,

i like the app i use the weekly planner widget thw most so it is easier to get organized it syncs with google calendar the only reason i am not giving it a 5 stars is becauae after an update it stopped updating the week on my screen and i have to search for the right week everytime,4,2020-06-29 04:57:58,0,
if you re familiar with stephen covey s product suite you ll find this tool to be an essential time management companion the interface is similar to the paper based system the application provides fields for tasks events etc there are supporting priority and notification features aiding in the arrangement and alerting of tasks the application would benefit from improvements with the synchronization of tasks across multiple devices,4,2020-06-27 00:41:50,21,
easy to navigate,4,2020-06-25 09:11:28,0,

just using basic to track milage works fine,4,2020-06-20 23:18:40,0,
i like the app and use it for everything my one complaint is the search mechanism does not always work i would like it to show all items that match the search request,4,2020-06-18 21:52:56,0,
i love that the app interface is so easy to use the reason i don t give it 5 stars is because you can t export notes it would be ideal if that could be done,4,2020-03-18 01:17:03,22,
i m using 2 calenders and 1 to do planner not including this all has their pros and functions i want yet they re different in style this is one of the best i just love using the week view seeing at one shot time of events laid out in planner including notes on that day with pics uploaded if needed it sync with my anydo planner which has a calender but i just love how i can use this a bit differently for scheduling best if only it has a daily mood tracker added in the notes function,4,2019-12-31 19:27:44,66,
this is the only app that does what it does and i love the functionality the only problem is the app is quite buggy and i haven t seen or noticed any updates in years would also be nice if there was a website to go with it i am finally giving up and moving to day by day which leverages google calendar and google tasks if google would just incorporate tasks into its calendar better that would do it all,4,2019-12-31 02:53:05,1,
great app i would rate it a 5 but there s an error where my completed tasks becomes unchecked constantly causing it to keep on becoming an unfinished task and it s annoying,4,2019-11-18 18:03:55,4,
i had a problem with upgrading to premium they were quick with their response and fixed the problem right away it s a good app for those familiar with the franklin covey system and syncs well across devices,4,2019-11-18 13:34:43,29,
after purchasing the pro version and having used this calendar app for almost 2 to 3 years now i have grown to truly love it it mimicks as close to the franklin covey planner s to any app out there i have found and this is what has drawn me to it i am increasing my rating to 4 stars because i have really had time to utilize all aspects of this calendar and i love that it will sink with my google calendar and other calendars i love this app i only wish it could print,4,2019-08-06 23:22:01,1,
osm osm osm osm,4,2019-05-03 15:30:53,0,
great app and the only flaw i see is that you can t yet export your data please make it so you can export data to something like pdf or something so i can save my entries forever,4,2019-03-02 23:22:28,3,
so far the best planner app i ever come across room for improvement i e to be accessible on pc as if some other app does,4,2019-02-14 21:59:52,1,
events sometimes take a while to show up on the day you selected for them other times a certain day will not be selectable choosing midnight as an ending time for an event doesn t seem to work,4,2019-02-01 22:32:23,0,
i love this app i have the pro version and the layout is very clean and organized however only 4 stars because it does not work on multiple devices,4,2018-12-21 09:25:05,0,
it is what i have looked for for some time i wish it could sync d across multiple devices,4,2018-12-05 09:04:27,0,
i wish i could create notes without having to select a date otherwise so far so nice,4,2018-12-05 07:51:35,0,
i do like the straight forwardness of this system it does what it says on the tin needs to keep developing but in the theme it s in if it gets to clever like some systems it will loss it s position,4,2018-11-14 02:52:03,9,
better to have a search option for notes,4,2018-11-05 23:44:50,0,
very easy to use have all i need,4,2018-10-09 20:36:15,0,
i would love this app so much more if part of the calendar wasn t obscured i don t mind the week number or anything i just wish i could see both it and the bottom of the calendar clearly,4,2018-07-29 19:24:26,1,
it takes time burpt good but it keeps getting out like you can t login,4,2018-07-11 14:06:57,0,
i don t quite get the categories for tasks i hope there is an option to hide it or remove it,4,2018-06-10 01:42:20,3,
this app would be so much more useful to me if i could order tasks by time hope you guys can fix this thank you great app good job,4,2018-05-15 05:09:33,1,
cool app seems to have all i need at this point my only 2c would be that the widget weekly view should have the option to see the 7 days ahead rather than the current week if it s a friday i don t really care what i did on monday i wanna know what s happening next monday,4,2018-05-02 09:02:09,52,
just a couple of things i don t like the fact that the reminders show up multiple times and i wish it had a to do list but other than that but other than that so far so good,4,2018-04-29 21:24:55,0,
just installed and am liking it so far i do wish there was a way to disable the quotes and better utilize that space to see more of my actual calendar also sub tasks would be very useful with those changes i might actually be able to downsize the apps i use,4,2018-04-10 23:56:44,18,
i just need notification tone more than these and much more long,4,2018-04-10 04:14:54,2,
seems like there is a bug when trying to sync my notes to my dropbox account would give you 5 stars if fixed,4,2018-04-08 17:38:22,0,
haven t found how to sync between two devices yet,4,2018-03-26 16:45:11,9,
things were going great until i switched to a new phone i can t find out how to sync my tasks and events to the new phone i installed the app in my new phone and logged in but the data is not there i see that the events comes from the google calendar and i may be able to do something about that but how do i sync the tasks pls help,4,2018-03-16 09:42:25,0,
great user interface easy to use syncing with google calendar is a huge advantage from to do lists to events you can schedule anything,4,2018-03-04 23:10:07,0,
i love this app i have always been a franklin covey planner gal and this is similar to the paper planner great search function,4,2018-02-12 23:34:42,0,
i really like this app for the most part but i really don t like how the month view in app and on the widget don t actually list out what you have on that day just colored dots would really like to be able to have this since i paid for the pro version please consider,4,2018-01-17 00:36:26,0,
i like this app it has a lot of the features i use all in one place however even though it lists all my google calendars i can t figure out how to do anything with them i have projects spread over a dozen calendars but i can t seem to add anything to any of them,4,2018-01-09 00:06:05,1,
its pretty good,4,2018-01-06 22:46:23,0,
nice apps but need to re download the full version,4,2017-12-08 20:46:47,0,
great app but would be good if you could edit tasks after you ve written them also would be good if it could have a daily things to do list on calendar which could be ticked off alongside projects tasks,4,2017-11-06 12:56:20,0,
overall a good app but i would also like the option of switching from landscape view,4,2017-10-31 22:41:45,0,
add alarms to notification in events or tasks and allow to add ringtone on it love it,4,2017-10-30 18:59:36,0,
great very usefull please add fitur search to find an old note,4,2017-10-21 16:21:39,0,
a great app i just downloaded it and i already love it the only issue here is slight ui bugs november 2017 gets covered up by the tabs at the top and on the day section the date runs into the calender layout again great app but those errors make the app look less professional i would recommend rescaling the fragments so they fit better on the page as well as the toolbar definitely am recommending to friends though,4,2017-10-10 07:04:51,92,
good enaught,4,2017-09-26 19:42:40,0,
the perfect planner only thing missing is that remimder is not working,4,2017-09-14 13:39:44,0,
this app is great but maybe let us tick task we completed from widget as it s annoying the app will opened up when i pressed the box to tick what i ve completed everytime,4,2017-09-05 10:29:57,0,
i think that feature of changing theme should be addef and apart from that there should also be a option for showing task on thr facr of calender itselg,4,2017-09-01 17:53:43,1,
i would like to be able to import my contacts to it i would give 5 stars for that,4,2017-08-09 21:11:15,5,
the essence and notion of this application is not just to define activities from day to day basis but to remind us that its really not about perfection its about progress this application teaches us not just to address holistically in our commitment and time management but also push drastically at the same time our attitude towards commitments senior project engineer here it really helps alot thank you,4,2017-08-08 11:04:08,9,
i really like this app its a lovely interface simple to use and very useful to have both tasks and notes with the calendar is there any possibility of adding a folder tag category function to the notes it would be so helpful i make notes on a varietu of things as i go along and its really useful to be able to store them by day but it would also be great to be able to sort them by tags or folders anyway just a suggestion otherwise a lovely app thanks,4,2017-07-31 02:15:52,339,
awesome app it helps me a lot to organize my life work and other stuffs the features are really amazing would recommend this to my friends and colleagues,4,2017-07-30 20:42:58,4,
almost perfect the only changes that would be helpful is a quicker way to switch from the week view to the task list and i would like to see my tasks as a list by default instead of clicking on the task categories also i wish that you had a rollover option for tasks i have yet to find an app that had this basically i wish when i create a task i could choose if the task carries forward to the next day if not completed or not,4,2017-07-18 00:01:20,13,
i went a got the full subscription and i really like it so far but i wish you could download it for your pc as well,4,2017-06-02 23:44:41,2,
it s cool,4,2017-06-02 08:50:48,0,
i just downloaded this the free version was definitely useful but i went ahead and got the paid version because i wanted to use the repetitive tasks and weekly planner as well i definitely think this will be worth the purchase,4,2017-05-27 21:23:33,11,
i really like this app and ised to love it until there was an update that was stopping me from using it without upgrading if i had to pay a one time purchase thats one thing but an annual fee give me a break 5 for a planner app is reasonable if you use it all of the time but not every year yall are greedy,4,2017-05-23 23:04:51,31,
this app is great but i have some suggestions that would even better improve the quality of using the app for example something like being able to edit the tasks widgets to show due soon instead of just tasks for that day for even better planning,4,2017-05-04 04:13:50,11,
great app help i unfortunately forgot my password i was very sure it s correct but i m not sure why it says it s wrong is there anything that can be done about it,4,2017-04-20 21:04:56,15,
this is a great planner app only thing missing is the ability to rotate into portrait or even rotate 180 degrees,4,2017-04-20 00:12:34,1,
the app was working fine until i removed google now now the widgets will not show on home page,4,2017-04-02 19:09:39,0,

almost all the functionality of the franklin planner this is a great app,4,2017-03-02 08:03:35,6,
the calendar reminders can be very shotty but the overall app is very useful,4,2017-02-13 21:02:03,3,
this is a simple app that gives me the capability of creating a to do list set event on my calendar and take notes,4,2017-02-09 10:51:53,1,
it s a really great app,4,2017-02-06 19:11:30,4,
if only the calender icons cld stop piling up on the phobe task bar everytime one is due so if i created 5 events to go off in an hr i ll have 5 icons piled up on my fone it s not needed or at least put an option so people cld disable it if they don t want it,4,2017-02-02 13:13:40,3,

it s a nice planner i just prefer a different layout i also don t care for the color,4,2016-09-08 03:33:40,0,
i just installed this gem of an app this morning and love its ease of use however there is a minor problem the date in big numbers on the left is one day behind the monthly calendar,4,2016-09-06 22:28:15,4,
great app and easy to use would be great if there was a no date option on notes for like shopping lists ect that aren t just for the day,4,2016-08-30 18:31:17,2,
it s generally good but screen rotation doesn t work so i can t use this app upside down in galaxy tab10 if this problem isn t solved i won t pay for the next year it would be great if this problem is solved,4,2016-08-30 13:26:12,0,
it is helpful,4,2016-08-13 22:27:05,1,
love the layout and automatic carryover of tasks to next day one problem i have installed planner pro on my ipad and my android phone the calendar events and tasks cannot be synced between my two devices very frustrated please add this sync feature soon,4,2016-08-06 02:46:48,0,
however there are a few bugs every so often one of my recurring tasks will appear twice on one day and i have to delete it the synchronization with drop box isn t good enough to use on two devices i would be useful if you could choose third sunday of every month for recurring tasks,4,2016-07-26 17:09:19,0,
good for studying,4,2016-07-21 09:52:40,1,
i like this app and use it on my android phone and ios ipad it s easy to use don t need to buy anything and is clear i don t love how some tasks are harder to remember and the reminder isn t how i expected but it s a good app,4,2016-07-18 07:46:16,0,
haven t been using this app for long but it seems great so far i love that incompleted tasks roll over to the current day i just wish you could attach attach photos or files to your notes that would make this a 5 star review,4,2016-07-14 01:45:19,9,
would love to be able to customize the app more need to add a dark theme and also add an agenda view,4,2016-07-06 23:33:03,1,
a today button would be helpful in the week view widget so that you don t have to scroll back and also the possibility to add more accounts are these features available in the pro version maybe the possibility to try it for a short period of time,4,2016-07-06 12:33:00,0,

why on earth when i m on one day and create a task it schedules it for the day before that by default just why,4,2016-06-01 03:39:28,6,

i love all the features but its still missing an events widget to show on the main screen like the task widget the planner gives me a feeling like it doesny care about events it doesny have notification for it or a list out for it is it possible to add the feature,4,2016-05-04 07:01:40,0,
it was very useful for me to plan my days until the latest update which the widget shows the wrong day and i am unable switch the day,4,2016-05-01 18:47:57,2,
this application is very useful in helping keep me organized and paced the only suggestion i d make is on the interface when checking off my tasks for the day the add new task button is in the way of pressing the cross off button it s a bit annoying but i love this app,4,2016-04-30 06:28:01,6,
i am the most unorganized person ever and this app has helped me a lot i constantly put down when my projects tests etc are due i even include my days off on it i also love that you can not down little notes with this app as well,4,2016-04-27 18:52:44,1,

its really good,4,2016-04-13 23:08:38,1,
only thing i don t like is that when creating a recurring event the date doesn t show on the monthly view until you scroll over to the actual week of the event it would be a lot better if i could see those dates on the monthly view without having to scroll fix please for 5 star rating,4,2016-04-13 15:44:12,0,
i finally found a easy functional planner that reminds me with a message perfectly timed i m a set it and forget it planner that plans a month out the messages keep me on task its tasks function is fluid enough that personal tasks can be added between as needed,4,2016-04-13 05:09:32,0,
